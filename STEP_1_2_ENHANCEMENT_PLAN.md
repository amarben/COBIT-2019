## ⚠️ Potential Challenges

### Step 1 Challenges
- **Low risk:** Mostly narration and timing enhancements
- May need slight UI tweaks to ensure card displays are visible

### Step 2 Challenges
- **Medium risk:** Requires more extensive changes
- **Analytics Dashboard:** May not exist in current UI - might need to be built or simulated
- **PDF Export:** Button may not be functional - might need to demonstrate concept
- **Rationale Text Entry:** Need to ensure rationale fields exist in forms
- **22 Processes:** Significantly longer video - need to balance detail vs. pacing

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Analytics Dashboard:** If not available, create mock data display or use creative camera work to show concept
2. **PDF Export:** Demonstrate button and explain functionality even if actual export isn't working
3. **Rationale Entry:** If fields don't exist, add console narration explaining what would be entered
4. **Pacing:** Use strategic pauses and section breaks to maintain engagement over 9-10 minutes
