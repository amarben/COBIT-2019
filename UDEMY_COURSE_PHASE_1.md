## Slide 2: Course Objectives

### Slide Title: What You Will Achieve in This Course

### Slide Notes:

This course has been carefully designed with clear, measurable learning objectives that will transform you from a COBIT novice to a confident implementer. By the end of this course, you will have achieved six major objectives that combine theoretical knowledge with practical implementation skills.

First, you will thoroughly understand the COBIT 2019 framework—its structure, components, domains, objectives, and underlying philosophy. You'll understand why COBIT is designed the way it is, how it differs from other frameworks, and why it's become the gold standard for IT governance. You'll be fluent in COBIT terminology and concepts, from governance versus management to the cascade from enterprise goals to governance objectives to processes to activities. This foundational understanding is essential because effective implementation requires deep comprehension of the framework's logic and design principles.

Second, you will master the COBIT implementation methodology—the systematic, step-by-step approach to implementing governance in any organization. You'll understand how to define governance context by identifying enterprise goals, mapping stakeholders, and assessing design factors. You'll know how to conduct rigorous capability assessments that honestly evaluate current maturity and quantify gaps. You'll be able to design tailored governance systems that balance competing demands for control, agility, innovation, and risk management. You'll understand how to select and prioritize governance objectives based on your specific context rather than implementing everything blindly. This methodological mastery ensures you can lead or participate in governance implementations confidently.

Third, you will gain extensive practical experience through the TechCorp case study that runs throughout the entire course. You'll see how a realistic organization with real challenges—regulatory pressure, cybersecurity threats, digital transformation demands, talent shortages—applies COBIT 2019 to address their specific needs. You'll witness their decision-making processes, see their assessment results, review their governance designs, and understand their prioritization rationale. This case study approach provides the practical wisdom that comes from seeing theory applied to complex, messy reality. You'll learn not just what to do, but how to navigate the organizational, political, and resource constraints that every real implementation faces.

Fourth, you will become proficient in using governance management platforms to document, track, and measure your COBIT implementation. Through detailed video demonstrations, you'll see exactly how to use application tools to capture governance context, record capability assessments, document governance structures, track implementation progress, and generate reports for stakeholders. This technical proficiency is invaluable because modern governance cannot be managed through spreadsheets and documents alone—you need purpose-built tools. The skills you develop here transfer to any governance management platform, whether you're using commercial GRC tools or custom-built systems.

Fifth, you will develop the ability to customize and tailor COBIT 2019 to your specific organizational context. One of COBIT's greatest strengths is its flexibility—it's a framework, not a rigid standard. You'll learn how to apply design factors, select appropriate objectives, set realistic target capability levels, and design governance structures that fit your organization's size, complexity, risk profile, and culture. You'll understand when to aim for high maturity and when to accept lower maturity. You'll know how to balance ideal governance with practical constraints. This customization skill is what separates effective implementers from those who blindly follow templates.

Sixth and finally, you will be prepared to immediately apply what you've learned in your own organization. This is not a course that leaves you wondering "now what?" Upon completion, you'll have a clear roadmap for initiating COBIT implementation, engaging stakeholders, conducting assessments, making design decisions, and tracking progress. You'll have seen the templates, tools, and techniques in action. You'll understand common pitfalls and how to avoid them. You'll be ready to be a change agent, bringing professional governance practices to your organization and demonstrating measurable value from IT investments. Whether you're starting from scratch or improving existing governance, you'll have the knowledge and confidence to succeed.

## Slide 3: Course Outline

### Slide Title: Your Learning Journey - What We'll Cover Together

### Slide Notes:

This course is organized into carefully sequenced phases that mirror the actual COBIT implementation methodology. Each phase builds on the previous one, creating a logical learning progression from foundational concepts through advanced optimization. Let me walk you through what we'll cover in each phase and how the course structure supports your learning.

Phase 1: Foundation & Assessment covers the critical groundwork for successful governance implementation. We'll start with Step 1: Governance Context Definition, where you'll learn how to identify enterprise goals, map stakeholders, and assess the design factors that shape your governance approach. You'll see how TechCorp documents their strategic objectives, regulatory environment, and stakeholder needs, creating the foundation for all subsequent decisions. Then we move to Step 2: Capability Assessment, where you'll master the COBIT maturity model and learn to honestly evaluate current governance capabilities across all 40 COBIT objectives. You'll watch TechCorp conduct their comprehensive assessment, see how they gather evidence, rate current and target maturity, and quantify the gaps they need to close. Finally, Step 3: Governance Design teaches you how to architect a governance system tailored to your context—designing governance principles, structures, decision-making frameworks, and reporting mechanisms. You'll see how TechCorp designs their multi-tiered governance system balancing strategic oversight with operational efficiency.

Phase 2: Process & Practice Definition takes you deeper into the operational aspects of governance implementation. Step 4: Governance Objectives Selection is where you learn to prioritize which COBIT objectives to focus on based on your enterprise goals and capability gaps. Not every organization needs to implement all 40 objectives at the same maturity level—you'll learn how to make strategic choices that maximize value. TechCorp will demonstrate their selection process, showing how they prioritize 22 high-priority objectives aligned with their financial services context. Step 5: Process Definition covers how to define detailed processes, activities, inputs, outputs, and roles for your selected objectives. You'll see how to customize COBIT processes to your organization rather than copying templates blindly. Step 6: Implementation Planning teaches you how to create realistic, phased implementation roadmaps with clear milestones, resource requirements, and success criteria.

Phase 3: Execution & Control focuses on actually implementing governance and establishing controls. Step 7: Process Implementation shows you how to roll out governance processes across the organization, train staff, deploy tools, and establish operating routines. Step 8: Control Implementation covers how to implement specific controls addressing risks and compliance requirements, ensuring your governance framework has teeth and delivers real risk management. Step 9: Change Management addresses the critical people side of governance—how to secure buy-in, overcome resistance, communicate effectively, and build governance culture.

Phase 4: Performance & Optimization brings it all together with measurement and continuous improvement. Step 10: Performance Measurement teaches you how to define metrics, establish dashboards, and measure governance effectiveness. You'll learn to measure not just process compliance but actual business outcomes and stakeholder value. Step 11: Continuous Improvement shows you how to establish continuous improvement cycles, conduct periodic reassessments, and evolve governance as business needs change. Step 12: Stakeholder Reporting covers how to communicate governance value to different stakeholder groups through tailored reporting and engagement.

Throughout every phase, you'll experience our unique three-part learning approach. First, we explain the concepts—what this step is, why it matters, and what it aims to achieve. Second, we show real-world application—how TechCorp applies these concepts to their specific situation, including their challenges, decisions, and trade-offs. Third, we demonstrate platform usage—detailed video walkthroughs showing exactly how to use the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform to document, track, and measure each step. This isn't passive learning—you'll see implementation happen in real-time, giving you the confidence and knowledge to replicate it in your environment.

What makes this course especially practical is that every concept is immediately applied in the platform demonstrations. You're not left wondering "how do I actually do this?" You see it done. You see how to enter data, make selections, document rationale, generate reports, and track progress. The application platform serves as both a learning tool and a template you can adapt for your own implementations. Many students use the platform demonstrations as blueprints for building similar tools in their organizations or configuring commercial GRC platforms.

By the end of the course, you'll have witnessed a complete, end-to-end COBIT 2019 implementation—from initial context definition through mature, continuously improving governance. You'll understand not just the "what" but the "how" and "why" of every decision. You'll have practical skills, not just theoretical knowledge. You'll be ready to lead governance transformation in your organization with confidence, armed with proven approaches, practical tools, and real-world examples.

# STEP 1: GOVERNANCE CONTEXT DEFINITION

## Slide 1: Step Overview

### Slide Title: Understanding Governance Context - The Foundation of IT Governance

### Slide Notes:

Welcome to the first critical step in implementing COBIT 2019: Governance Context Definition. This foundational step is essential because it establishes the "why" behind your governance framework. Before diving into processes, controls, or technical implementations, we must first understand the enterprise context in which IT operates. This step answers fundamental questions: What are we trying to achieve as an organization? Who are our stakeholders and what do they need from IT? What strategic goals must IT enable? Without this clarity, any governance framework we build will lack direction and alignment with business objectives.

The Governance Context Definition involves three interconnected activities. First, we identify and articulate enterprise goals using the Balanced Scorecard framework, which ensures we consider goals across financial, customer, internal process, and learning and growth perspectives. This holistic view prevents us from focusing solely on financial metrics while neglecting customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, or employee development. Second, we map stakeholders and their specific needs, recognizing that different groups—from the board of directors to customers to regulators—have distinct expectations of IT. Third, we assess design factors that shape our governance approach, including enterprise strategy, risk profile, IT's role in the organization, compliance requirements, threat landscape, and technology adoption posture.

Why is this step so critical? Because governance is not one-size-fits-all. A conservative bank with stringent regulatory requirements needs very different governance compared to a fast-moving fintech startup. An organization where IT is a strategic differentiator requires different governance than one where IT is purely a support function. By thoroughly understanding our governance context, we create a framework that is fit-for-purpose, aligned with strategic objectives, and responsive to stakeholder needs. This contextual foundation ensures that every subsequent decision—from selecting governance objectives to defining processes to establishing metrics—is grounded in what matters most to the organization. Without this foundation, we risk building governance structures that are theoretically sound but practically disconnected from business reality.

### Bullet Points:

- **Enterprise Goal Identification**: Define clear, measurable goals across all four Balanced Scorecard perspectives to ensure holistic organizational alignment
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identify all key stakeholders, understand their unique needs, and establish engagement strategies for transparent communication
- **Strategic Alignment**: Ensure IT governance framework directly supports and enables enterprise strategy and business objectives
- **Risk Profile Assessment**: Understand organizational risk appetite and tolerance to shape appropriate governance controls and decision-making frameworks
- **IT Role Definition**: Clarify IT's strategic role—whether utility, enabler, or differentiator—to determine governance intensity and focus areas
- **Compliance Landscape**: Map all regulatory, legal, and industry requirements that constrain and shape governance decisions
- **Environmental Factors**: Consider threat landscape, technology trends, and adoption posture to ensure governance remains relevant and forward-looking
- **Contextual Customization**: Recognize that effective governance must be tailored to organizational context rather than applying generic best practices

## Slide 2: Application by the Model Company

### Slide Title: TechCorp Financial Services - Defining Governance Context

### Slide Notes:

TechCorp Financial Services provides an excellent real-world example of comprehensive governance context definition. As a $3.2 billion financial services organization with 8,500 employees operating across 15 countries, TechCorp faces complex governance challenges that require careful context analysis. The company operates in the highly regulated banking and fintech space, where IT is not merely a support function but a core business differentiator. With 75% of customer interactions occurring through digital channels, IT governance directly impacts customer experience, competitive positioning, and regulatory compliance.

TechCorp's governance context definition began with selecting 13 enterprise goals spanning all Balanced Scorecard perspectives. From the financial perspective, they prioritized stakeholder value, competitive product portfolios, managed risk, and regulatory compliance. Customer perspective goals included service excellence, 99.95% system availability, and quality management information. Internal process goals focused on optimizing functionality and costs while managing change programs effectively. Learning and growth goals emphasized policy compliance, skilled people, and innovation culture. This comprehensive goal selection reflects TechCorp's recognition that IT must deliver value across multiple dimensions, not just cost efficiency or system uptime.

Governance challenges were identified to capture the critical obstacles TechCorp must address. Four key challenges were documented: digital transformation and cloud migration (moving legacy systems to modern cloud infrastructure), regulatory compliance spanning PCI-DSS, SOC 2, and GDPR requirements, cybersecurity threats and data protection in an increasingly hostile threat landscape, and legacy system modernization to replace aging core banking platforms. These challenges directly inform governance priorities and help justify governance investments to stakeholders.

Stakeholder mapping identified three critical high-priority stakeholder groups. The Board of Directors requires risk oversight, strategic IT investments aligned with business goals, and regulatory compliance assurance. The Chief Executive Officer needs IT enabling business strategy, competitive advantage through technology, and clear ROI on technology investments. The Chief Risk Officer focuses on comprehensive risk management, cybersecurity posture, regulatory compliance, and business continuity capabilities. Each stakeholder's specific needs were documented with priority levels (all marked as High priority), ensuring the governance framework addresses executive-level expectations and concerns.

### TechCorp Governance Context Summary Table:

| **Context Element** | **TechCorp Reality** | **Governance Implications** |
|---------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Organization Profile** | TechCorp Financial Services Inc. | $3.2B revenue, 8,500 employees in banking/fintech sector |
| **Industry** | Banking & Financial Technology | Heavily regulated; Security paramount; 24/7 availability |
| **IT Strategic Role** | Strategic enabler & differentiator | IT is core to business operations and customer experience |

## Slide 3: Video Demo Narrative

### Video Title: Navigating the Governance Context Module in the COBIT 2019 Platform

### Video Notes:

Welcome to the hands-on demonstration of Step 1: Governance Context Definition in our COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. In this demo, we'll walk through how TechCorp Financial Services uses the platform to define and document their governance context. Let's begin by opening the application. We navigate to Step 1: Governance Context from the main dashboard. Notice how the platform presents a clean, organized interface guiding us through four main sections: Enterprise Information, Enterprise Goals, Key Governance Challenges, and Stakeholder Needs.

**Organization Profile Section**

We start with the Enterprise Information section where we document TechCorp's basic organizational profile. The platform provides four structured fields. In Organization Name, we enter "TechCorp Financial Services Inc." to formally identify the organization. In the Industry field, we document "Banking and Financial Technology (FinTech)" to capture our sector context. For Organization Size, we enter "8,500 employees, $3.2B annual revenue" providing a clear picture of organizational scale. Finally, in the IT Role field, we document "Strategic enabler and core business differentiator for digital banking innovation" emphasizing that IT is not a support function but central to business strategy. These four fields create the foundational organizational context for everything that follows.

**Enterprise Goals Section**

Next, we move to Enterprise Goals. The platform displays all 13 enterprise goals from the COBIT framework, organized by Balanced Scorecard perspective. We see the Financial perspective section first, showing four goals. We click on "EG01: Stakeholder value of business investments" to select it. Notice the checkmark appears and the button highlights in teal, indicating this goal is relevant to TechCorp. We continue selecting goals that align with TechCorp's strategy. For the Financial perspective, we select all four goals because financial performance, competitive products, risk management, and regulatory compliance are all critical for a financial services organization.

Moving to the Customer perspective, we select three goals: customer-oriented service culture, business service continuity and availability, and agility to respond to changing business environment. These selections reflect TechCorp's focus on customer experience and reliable service delivery in a highly competitive market. For the Internal perspective, we select three goals: quality of management information, optimization of internal business process functionality, and optimization of business process costs. This reflects TechCorp's drive for operational excellence and data-driven decision-making.

Finally, in the Learning and Growth perspective, we select all three goals: skilled and motivated people, product and business innovation culture, and management of business change programs. The platform automatically tracks our selections, showing "13 goals selected across 4 perspectives" at the bottom of the section. This comprehensive selection signals to everyone reviewing the governance framework that TechCorp is pursuing balanced, holistic value creation rather than optimizing for a single dimension like cost reduction or compliance alone.

**Key Governance Challenges Section**

We scroll down to the Key Governance Challenges section. This is where we identify and document the major obstacles and priorities that governance must address. The platform provides an input field and an "Add" button allowing us to build a list of challenges. We click in the challenge input field and type our first challenge: "Digital transformation and cloud migration." We click Add, and the challenge appears in a gray box below with a remove icon. We continue adding challenges that reflect TechCorp's current reality.

We add "Regulatory compliance (PCI-DSS, SOC 2, GDPR)" as our second challenge, acknowledging the complex regulatory environment in financial services. We add "Cybersecurity threats and data protection" as the third challenge, recognizing the constant threat landscape facing financial institutions. Finally, we add "Legacy system modernization" as our fourth challenge, capturing the technical debt and modernization needs TechCorp faces. The platform displays all four challenges in a clean list format. This challenge list provides important context for governance prioritization—when we select governance objectives in Step 4, we'll reference these challenges to ensure our governance framework addresses the most critical organizational needs.

**Stakeholder Needs Section**

Now we move to the Stakeholder Needs section. The platform displays a three-column input grid with fields for Name, Needs, and Priority, along with an Add button. This interface allows us to systematically capture stakeholder information. We start with our first critical stakeholder: the Board of Directors. We click in the Name field and type "Board of Directors." We tab to the Needs field and enter "Risk oversight, strategic IT investments aligned with business goals, regulatory compliance assurance." This captures the board's primary expectations from IT governance. We select "High" from the Priority dropdown menu, then click the Add button.

The stakeholder appears in a display card below the input grid, showing the name, priority badge (colored red for High), and the full needs description. We repeat this process for our second stakeholder. We enter "Chief Executive Officer" in the Name field. In Needs, we document "IT enabling business strategy, competitive advantage through technology, clear ROI." We set Priority to High and click Add. The CEO stakeholder now appears in the list below.

For our third stakeholder, we enter "Chief Risk Officer" in the Name field. In the Needs field, we document "Comprehensive risk management, cybersecurity posture, regulatory compliance, business continuity." We set Priority to High and click Add. Now we have three key stakeholders documented, each with High priority and clearly articulated needs. The platform displays these stakeholders in expandable cards, making it easy to review and edit if stakeholder needs evolve over time. Notice that we're focusing on executive-level stakeholders who have direct governance oversight responsibilities—this ensures our governance framework is designed to meet C-suite and board expectations.

**Saving the Context**

We scroll to the bottom of the page where we see a "Save Governance Context" button with a save icon. We click this button, and the platform confirms that our governance context has been saved successfully. We can now navigate back to the dashboard to verify our progress. We click on the Dashboard link in the left navigation. The dashboard updates to show that Step 1 is complete, with our organization profile, 13 selected enterprise goals, 4 governance challenges, and 3 key stakeholders all documented and ready to inform subsequent implementation steps.

This documented context becomes the foundation for every subsequent step in our COBIT implementation. When we select governance objectives in Step 4, we'll refer back to these 13 enterprise goals to ensure alignment. When we assess capability in Step 2, we'll consider these governance challenges and stakeholder needs. When we design our governance system in Step 3, we'll ensure it addresses the expectations of our board, CEO, and CRO. The governance context we've defined provides the "why" behind all governance decisions, ensuring our framework is purposeful, relevant, and aligned with enterprise needs rather than generic best practices applied blindly.

# STEP 2: CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT

## Slide 1: Step Overview

### Slide Title: Assessing Current Governance Capability - Knowing Where You Stand

### Slide Notes:

Step 2 of the COBIT 2019 implementation is Capability Assessment, where we honestly evaluate our organization's current governance and management capability maturity. This step is essential because it establishes our baseline—where we are today—and quantifies the gaps between current state and target state. Without an accurate assessment of current capabilities, we cannot effectively prioritize improvement efforts, allocate resources appropriately, or measure progress over time. Many organizations make the mistake of jumping directly to designing their desired future state without understanding their starting point, resulting in unrealistic implementation plans and wasted resources.

The capability assessment uses the COBIT maturity model, which defines six levels from 0 to 5. Level 0 means the process is incomplete or not performed at all. Level 1, Performed, indicates the process achieves its purpose but is ad-hoc and reactive. Level 2, Managed, means the process is planned, monitored, and adjusted, with work products established. Level 3, Established, indicates the process is formally defined, documented, and consistently followed across the organization. Level 4, Predictable, means the process operates within defined limits and is measured, controlled, and can reliably achieve outcomes. Level 5, Optimizing, represents continuous process improvement based on quantitative understanding of performance and innovation. This graduated scale allows for nuanced assessment rather than binary "compliant or not" judgments.

The assessment covers all 40 COBIT objectives: 5 governance objectives in the EDM domain and 35 management objectives across APO, BAI, DSS, and MEA domains. In our implementation platform, we demonstrate the assessment process using 27 carefully selected critical processes that represent approximately 67% of the COBIT framework and cover the most essential governance and management objectives across all domains. For each objective, we assess current capability level and define target capability level. The gap between current and target becomes our improvement roadmap. We also assign priority—High, Medium, or Low—based on enterprise goals, risk profile, and stakeholder needs documented in Step 1. This prioritization is critical because most organizations cannot close all gaps simultaneously and must focus resources on the highest-impact improvements.

Conducting an effective capability assessment requires honesty, evidence, and diverse perspectives. We gather evidence through document review, interviews with process owners, observation of actual practices, and review of metrics and outcomes. We involve multiple stakeholders to avoid bias—IT leadership, process owners, internal audit, and even external consultants for objectivity. The goal is not to achieve high scores but to accurately understand reality. Organizations that inflate their assessment scores only delay real improvement and risk building governance on false foundations. Conversely, being overly critical serves no purpose either. The assessment should be balanced, evidence-based, and focused on understanding both strengths to build upon and gaps to address. This honest baseline becomes the foundation for designing a realistic, achievable implementation roadmap.

### Bullet Points:

- **Baseline Establishment**: Create accurate current-state snapshot of governance capabilities across all 40 COBIT objectives to establish improvement starting point
- **Maturity Model Application**: Use 0-5 capability levels to assess each objective, providing nuanced understanding beyond simple pass/fail judgments
- **Gap Analysis**: Calculate capability gaps between current state and target state for each objective to quantify improvement requirements
- **Priority Assignment**: Classify each objective as High, Medium, or Low priority based on enterprise goals, risk profile, and stakeholder needs
- **Evidence-Based Assessment**: Gather objective evidence through document review, interviews, process observation, and metrics rather than subjective opinions
- **Multi-Stakeholder Involvement**: Include IT leadership, process owners, internal audit, and external perspectives to ensure balanced, unbiased assessment
- **Domain Coverage**: Assess all five domains—EDM (Governance), APO (Align/Plan/Organize), BAI (Build/Acquire/Implement), DSS (Deliver/Service/Support), MEA (Monitor/Evaluate/Assess)
- **Honest Evaluation**: Focus on accurate assessment rather than favorable scores, recognizing that inflated assessments only delay genuine improvement

## Slide 2: Application by the Model Company

### Slide Title: TechCorp Financial Services - Comprehensive Capability Assessment

### Slide Notes:

TechCorp Financial Services conducted a rigorous capability assessment across the COBIT framework, engaging internal audit to facilitate the process and ensure objectivity. The assessment team included IT leadership, process owners from each domain, risk management, compliance, and operations personnel. They gathered evidence over six weeks through documentation review, structured interviews, process observations, and analysis of existing metrics. The assessment methodology followed the COBIT Process Assessment Model, ensuring consistency and comparability. TechCorp focused their detailed assessment on 27 critical processes spanning all five domains—5 governance objectives from EDM, 9 from APO, 5 from BAI, 6 from DSS, and 2 from MEA. For each assessed process, they documented not just numerical ratings but detailed rationale explaining the evidence behind their assessments, making the evaluation transparent and defensible to stakeholders. Let's examine their results and what they reveal about TechCorp's governance maturity.

The assessment revealed an overall average current capability of 2.4, placing TechCorp between "Managed" and "Established" maturity. This means most processes exist, are planned and monitored, but are not yet fully standardized or predictable. TechCorp's target average is 4.0 (Predictable), representing an ambitious but achievable 1.6-level improvement. This gap quantifies the improvement journey ahead. Interestingly, the assessment showed varying maturity across domains. The DSS domain (Deliver, Service, Support) scored highest at 2.9, reflecting TechCorp's operational strength in running IT services. The EDM governance domain scored lowest at 2.2, indicating that while operational processes are relatively mature, strategic governance structures need significant development.

Let's examine specific high-priority gaps. EDM02 (Ensured Benefits Delivery) received the lowest score: current capability of 1 (Performed), target of 4, creating a critical 3-level gap. TechCorp acknowledged they had no systematic benefits tracking—IT investments were approved based on business cases, but whether promised benefits materialized was rarely verified. This gap directly impacts stakeholder confidence and the ability to optimize the IT portfolio. EDM01 (Governance Framework) scored 2 with a target of 4, a 2-level gap. Basic governance structures exist—IT steering committee, some policies—but lack standardization, consistent application, and predictable outcomes. EDM03 (Risk Optimization) scored better at 3 but still has a 1-level gap to reach the target of 4, requiring better integration with enterprise risk management and more predictive risk analytics.

In the APO domain, several high-priority gaps emerged. APO13 (Managed Security) and APO12 (Managed Risk) both scored 3 with ambitious targets of 5, reflecting TechCorp's recognition that as a financial services firm, security and risk must be world-class, not just adequate. APO07 (Managed Human Resources) scored 2 with a target of 4, highlighting challenges in talent management—a critical issue given the 14% turnover rate. APO14 (Managed Data) scored 2, indicating data governance is nascent, a concern for an organization subject to GDPR and data privacy regulations. APO05 (Portfolio Management) scored 2 despite being high priority, showing that while portfolio processes exist, they need significant maturity improvement to optimize value delivery.

The BAI domain showed solid capability in BAI03 (Solutions Identification and Build) at level 3, reflecting TechCorp's relatively mature Agile development practices. However, BAI05 (Organizational Change) scored only 1, revealing a major weakness—technology changes outpace the organization's ability to absorb them, explaining why projects technically succeed but fail to deliver expected benefits. BAI11 (Projects) scored 2 with a high-priority 2-level gap, explaining the 73% on-time delivery rate. The DSS domain showed the strongest performance, with DSS01 (Operations), DSS02 (Service Requests and Incidents), and DSS04 (Continuity) all at level 3. This reflects TechCorp's investment in ITSM tooling and operational discipline. However, even these relatively mature processes have 1-2 level gaps to reach targets.

The MEA domain revealed interesting insights. MEA02 (Internal Controls) scored 3, reflecting SOX compliance maturity, but MEA01 (Performance Monitoring) scored only 2, indicating that while controls exist, performance measurement and continuous monitoring need significant improvement. MEA03 (Compliance) scored 3 but targets 5, reflecting the high stakes of regulatory compliance in financial services. This comprehensive assessment provides TechCorp with a clear, evidence-based roadmap. The 22 high-priority gaps become the focus of improvement initiatives. The assessment results were presented to the Board, IT Steering Committee, and executive leadership, creating shared understanding of governance maturity and the investment required to close gaps. This transparency builds stakeholder confidence and secures commitment for the multi-year governance improvement journey.

### TechCorp Capability Assessment Summary:

| **Domain** | **Objectives** | **Avg Current** | **Avg Target** | **Avg Gap** | **High Priority Gaps** | **Key Findings** |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------|------------------------|------------------|
| **EDM (Governance)** | 5 | 2.2 | 4.0 | 1.8 | All 5 objectives | Governance structures exist but lack maturity and consistency |
| **APO (Align/Plan/Organize)** | 14 | 2.4 | 4.0 | 1.6 | 9 objectives | Mixed maturity; Strategic processes stronger than operational planning |
| **BAI (Build/Acquire/Implement)** | 11 | 2.3 | 3.8 | 1.5 | 5 objectives | Development practices maturing but change management weak |
| **DSS (Deliver/Service/Support)** | 6 | 2.9 | 4.2 | 1.3 | All 6 objectives | Strongest domain; Operational maturity evident; Still gaps to targets |

## Slide 3: Video Demo Narrative

### Video Title: Conducting Capability Assessment in the COBIT 2019 Platform

### Video Notes:

Welcome to our demonstration of Step 2: Capability Assessment using the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. In this walkthrough, we'll see how TechCorp Financial Services documented their capability assessment results across 27 critical processes spanning all five COBIT domains. We begin by navigating from the main dashboard to Step 2: Capability Assessment. The platform presents a comprehensive interface showing the selected governance and management objectives organized by domain. We see the EDM section first, followed by APO, BAI, DSS, and MEA. Each objective displays key information: the objective code, name, current capability level, target capability level, gap, and priority.

Let's start by assessing our first governance objective. We click on EDM01: Ensured Governance Framework Setting and Maintenance. A detailed assessment form opens. We see fields for Current Capability Level, Target Capability Level, Priority, and a Rationale text area. The platform provides a dropdown for Current Capability Level with options from 0 to 5, each labeled with its maturity name: 0-Incomplete, 1-Performed, 2-Managed, 3-Established, 4-Predictable, 5-Optimizing. We select level 2 (Managed) because TechCorp has basic governance structures in place—an IT steering committee meets regularly, there's a governance policy, but processes aren't fully standardized or predictable.

Now we set the Target Capability Level. We select 4 (Predictable) because TechCorp wants governance that operates within defined limits, is measured and controlled, and reliably achieves outcomes. We're not targeting level 5 (Optimizing) for this objective right now because continuous optimization can come later once predictability is achieved. The platform automatically calculates the gap: 2 levels. This quantifies the improvement required. We set Priority to High because governance framework is foundational—without this, other improvements struggle.

**Documenting Evidence-Based Rationale**

Now we come to a critical feature of the platform: the Rationale text area. This is where TechCorp documents the evidence and reasoning behind their assessment, making it transparent and defensible. In the Rationale field, we type: "Basic governance structures exist but lack standardization and predictability. Need formal governance charter and consistent application." This rationale ensures future readers—whether internal stakeholders, auditors, or executives—understand why these ratings were assigned. The rationale field transforms the assessment from subjective opinion into evidence-based evaluation. When the Board or IT Steering Committee reviews this assessment, they can see not just a number but the reasoning and evidence that supports it.

We click Save and the assessment for EDM01 is recorded. The platform updates the summary view, showing EDM01 with current 2, target 4, gap 2, priority High. We continue with the next objective, EDM02: Ensured Benefits Delivery. We click to open the assessment form. This one is particularly challenging—TechCorp honestly acknowledges they have virtually no systematic benefits tracking. Individual project managers might track some metrics, but there's no enterprise-wide benefits realization process. We select Current Capability Level 1 (Performed). The process purpose is achieved occasionally but it's ad-hoc and reactive. For target, we again select 4 (Predictable) because stakeholders demand clear evidence of IT value delivery. This creates a 3-level gap, the largest in our assessment. Priority is High because this directly impacts stakeholder confidence and portfolio optimization decisions.

We document the rationale: "Limited benefits tracking for IT investments. Need structured portfolio value management and benefits realization processes." We save this assessment and move to EDM03: Ensured Risk Optimization. Here, TechCorp is stronger—they have a mature risk management function and integrated IT risks into the enterprise risk register. We select Current Capability 3 (Established) because risk processes are formally defined and consistently followed. Target is 4, creating a 1-level gap. Priority remains High given the financial services regulatory environment. Rationale: "Strong risk management foundation but needs better integration with enterprise risk management and predictive risk analytics."

We continue through all five EDM objectives, then move to the APO domain. The platform displays 14 APO objectives. Let's assess APO13: Managed Security, a high-priority objective for TechCorp. We click to open the form. TechCorp has comprehensive security policies, a Security Operations Center, regular security assessments, and integration with risk management. This merits Current Capability 3 (Established). However, as a financial services firm and high-value target, TechCorp targets level 5 (Optimizing) for security—they want continuous improvement, threat intelligence integration, and proactive security posture. This creates a 2-level gap. Priority is High. Rationale documents their security maturity journey and the need for zero trust architecture and advanced threat protection.

We assess APO07: Managed Human Resources. TechCorp's 14% turnover rate and recruitment challenges indicate HR processes need improvement. Current Capability is 2 (Managed)—there are processes for recruiting and onboarding, but they're not optimized. Target is 4 (Predictable) because talent is critical to TechCorp's digital strategy. Gap is 2 levels. Priority is High. We document concerns about talent retention and the need for competency frameworks and career development programs. As we work through APO objectives, we see varying maturity—some like APO02 (Strategy) are relatively strong at level 3, while others like APO04 (Innovation) are weak at level 1.

Moving to the BAI domain, we assess 11 objectives related to building and implementing solutions. BAI03 (Solutions Identification and Build) scores well at 3 because TechCorp has embraced Agile methodologies and development practices are mature. However, BAI05 (Organizational Change Management) scores poorly at 1—TechCorp admits they focus on technical implementation but neglect organizational change, explaining why projects deliver technology but don't always achieve business outcomes. This is marked Medium priority for now but will move to High in future phases. BAI11 (Projects) is assessed at 2 with target 4, explaining the 73% on-time delivery rate. The platform makes it easy to see patterns—BAI domain shows strong technical delivery but weak organizational enablement.

The DSS domain is TechCorp's strength. We assess DSS01 (Operations) at level 3—operations are well-defined, documented, and consistently executed. Target is 4, showing there's still room for improvement toward predictable, measured operations. DSS02 (Service Requests and Incidents) is also 3—the ServiceNow ITSM platform provides structure and consistency. DSS05 (Security Services) is 3, reflecting the 24/7 Security Operations Center. All six DSS objectives are assessed at level 3, indicating operational maturity. However, all target level 4 or 5, showing TechCorp's commitment to operational excellence.

Finally, we assess the MEA domain. MEA02 (Internal Control System) scores 3, reflecting years of SOX compliance work. MEA03 (External Compliance) also scores 3—TechCorp has compliance processes for GDPR, PCI-DSS, and other regulations, though two recent audit findings indicate gaps. Target is 5 for MEA03 because regulatory violations in financial services can be catastrophic. MEA01 (Performance Monitoring) scores only 2—while some performance metrics exist, there's no comprehensive performance monitoring framework. This is a key gap to address.

**Analytics Dashboard - Visualizing Assessment Results**

After completing all 27 assessments across the five domains, we scroll down to the Analytics section of the platform. This is where the real power of systematic capability assessment becomes visible. The platform automatically generates comprehensive analytics that transform individual assessments into strategic insights. Let's explore what the analytics dashboard reveals about TechCorp's governance maturity.

First, we see the Assessment Statistics table, which provides a quantitative summary of the entire assessment. The table shows Total Processes Assessed: 27, representing our strategic focus on critical processes across all domains. Average Current Capability: 2.4, placing TechCorp between "Managed" and "Established" maturity—processes exist and are monitored but not yet fully standardized. Average Target Capability: 4.0 ("Predictable"), showing TechCorp's ambition to achieve measured, controlled, predictable governance. Average Gap: 1.6 levels, quantifying the improvement journey ahead. Largest Gap: 3 levels for EDM02 (Benefits Delivery), highlighting the most critical improvement area. This statistics table gives executives an at-a-glance understanding of where the organization stands and what improvement is required.

Below the statistics table, we see the Priority Distribution visualization. This shows how assessments are distributed across priority levels. The platform displays: High Priority: 18 processes (67%), Medium Priority: 7 processes (26%), Low Priority: 2 processes (7%). This distribution reveals that TechCorp has identified two-thirds of assessed processes as high priority, reflecting the significant governance maturity gap and the strategic importance of IT governance in their financial services context. The visualization uses color coding—red for high priority, orange for medium, green for low—making it immediately clear where attention must focus.

The platform then generates Key Insights, automatically analyzing the assessment data to surface important patterns and trends. We see several insights displayed in expandable cards. The first insight reads: "EDM domain shows lowest average maturity (2.2) - strategic governance structures need significant development." This algorithmic insight draws attention to a critical finding that might otherwise be buried in detailed data. The second insight states: "DSS domain demonstrates strongest capability (2.9) - operational processes are relatively mature." This highlights an organizational strength to build upon. The third insight notes: "18 high-priority gaps identified - significant governance investment required to close critical maturity gaps." This insight translates assessment data into resource planning implications that resonate with executive stakeholders and CFOs evaluating governance budgets.

Finally, we see the Domain Summary visualization, which breaks down capability by COBIT domain. The platform presents a clean table showing each domain with its average current capability, average target capability, and average gap. EDM (Governance): Current 2.2, Target 4.0, Gap 1.8—highlighting the strategic governance maturity challenge. APO (Align/Plan/Organize): Current 2.4, Target 4.0, Gap 1.6—showing planning and alignment processes need significant improvement. BAI (Build/Acquire/Implement): Current 2.3, Target 3.8, Gap 1.5—development and implementation capabilities require enhancement. DSS (Deliver/Service/Support): Current 2.9, Target 4.2, Gap 1.3—the most mature domain but still with meaningful gaps. MEA (Monitor/Evaluate/Assess): Current 2.5, Target 4.2, Gap 1.7—monitoring and measurement capabilities need development. This domain-level view helps stakeholders understand which areas of IT governance and management need the most attention and investment.

The analytics dashboard transforms raw assessment data into actionable intelligence. Rather than presenting stakeholders with 27 individual assessments to digest, the platform synthesizes key findings, highlights critical patterns, and presents insights in formats that support decision-making. When TechCorp presents these results to their IT Steering Committee and Board, the analytics dashboard tells a clear story: operational processes are relatively mature but strategic governance, planning, and measurement capabilities need significant development. The 1.6-level average gap is substantial but achievable with focused multi-year investment. The concentration of high-priority gaps signals the urgency and importance of governance improvement.

**Exporting and Reporting Assessment Results**

The platform provides a comprehensive export function that allows TechCorp to generate professional capability assessment reports for various stakeholders. We click the "Export Assessment Report" button, and the platform presents export options. We can choose between PDF format for formal documentation and presentations, or CSV format for further data analysis in Excel or PowerBI. We select PDF export to create a formal assessment report for the IT Steering Committee and Board.

The platform generates a comprehensive report that includes several key sections. First, an Executive Summary page presents the overall assessment results—27 processes assessed, average current capability of 2.4, average target of 4.0, average gap of 1.6 levels, and the distribution of high/medium/low priority gaps. This one-page summary allows executives to quickly grasp the assessment results without diving into details. Second, a Domain Analysis section provides the breakdown by COBIT domain, showing that DSS is the most mature domain while EDM needs the most development. Third, the Detailed Assessment section lists all 27 assessed processes with their current level, target level, gap, priority, and—critically—the documented rationale explaining the evidence and reasoning behind each rating.

The inclusion of detailed rationale in the export report is a game-changer for stakeholder communication. When the IT Steering Committee reviews EDM02 (Benefits Delivery) and sees the assessment of Current Level 1, they can immediately read the rationale: "Limited benefits tracking for IT investments. Need structured portfolio value management and benefits realization processes." This transforms the assessment from abstract numbers into concrete, evidence-based findings that stakeholders can discuss, challenge, and validate. The rationale also provides audit trail documentation—if external auditors or regulators ask how capability was assessed, TechCorp can point to documented evidence and reasoning.

Fourth, the report includes the Analytics Dashboard visualizations—the priority distribution chart, domain summary table, and key insights. These visualizations make the report more engaging and accessible to non-technical stakeholders. Fifth, a Recommendations section based on the gap analysis suggests prioritized improvement initiatives. For TechCorp, the report recommends prioritizing governance framework formalization (EDM01), benefits realization process implementation (EDM02), and security maturity enhancement (APO13) as the highest-impact improvements.

We save the PDF report and share it with the IT Steering Committee for review and validation. During the review meeting, committee members appreciate the transparency and evidence-based approach. They challenge a few ratings—for example, they believe APO07 (Human Resources) should be rated higher given recent talent management investments. We discuss the evidence, and the team agrees that while initiatives are underway, they haven't yet achieved the "Established" maturity level required for a rating of 3. However, they suggest we update the rationale to acknowledge the in-progress initiatives, which we do directly in the platform.

After incorporating feedback, we mark the assessment as "Validated" in the platform, noting the validation date and the validating body (IT Steering Committee). This validated assessment becomes the official baseline for TechCorp's governance improvement journey. The platform stores this baseline assessment, and we'll repeat the assessment every six months to measure improvement progress. The platform's assessment history feature will allow us to track trends over time—visualizing which objectives are improving, which remain stuck, and whether improvement initiatives are effective. This longitudinal view transforms capability assessment from a one-time snapshot into an ongoing management tool that keeps governance improvement grounded in objective measurement, transparency, and continuous learning.

# STEP 3: GOVERNANCE DESIGN

## Slide 1: Step Overview

### Slide Title: Applying COBIT Design Factors - Tailoring the Framework

### Slide Notes:

Step 3, Governance Design using COBIT Design Factors, is where we customize the COBIT framework to our specific organizational context. This step builds directly on the enterprise context we defined in Step 1 and the capability gaps we identified in Step 2. COBIT 2019 recognizes that governance is not one-size-fits-all—different organizations need different governance approaches based on their unique circumstances. The design factors provide a systematic way to tailor COBIT to your specific context, ensuring the governance framework you implement is fit-for-purpose rather than generic best practices applied blindly.

COBIT 2019 defines seven key design factors that influence how you should customize your governance system. These design factors help you answer critical questions: Which governance objectives are most relevant to us? What level of maturity should we target for each objective? How should we prioritize governance investments? What controls and practices are most important given our specific risks and regulatory environment? By thoroughly analyzing and documenting these design factors, we create a foundation for intelligent governance customization in subsequent implementation steps.

The seven COBIT design factors are: Enterprise Strategy (how IT supports your business direction and competitive positioning), Enterprise Goals Alignment (how your selected enterprise goals translate into IT governance priorities), Risk Profile (your organization's risk appetite and key risk concerns that governance must address), IT Role (whether IT is a support function, factory, turnaround enabler, or strategic differentiator), Compliance Requirements (the regulatory and legal obligations that constrain governance choices), Threat Landscape (the security threats and vulnerabilities your organization faces), and Technology Adoption (your approach to emerging technologies and innovation). Each factor provides a different lens through which to view governance needs, and together they create a comprehensive picture of your governance context.

Understanding and documenting these design factors is essential because they directly influence governance decisions in later steps. For example, an organization with a conservative risk profile and stringent compliance requirements (like a bank) will emphasize different governance objectives and target higher maturity levels for risk and compliance processes compared to a technology startup with an aggressive growth strategy and moderate risk appetite. An organization where IT is a strategic differentiator will invest more heavily in innovation governance and portfolio management compared to one where IT is purely a support function. The threat landscape determines the priority and maturity targets for security-related governance objectives. By systematically analyzing each design factor, we ensure our governance framework is tailored to our specific reality rather than implementing generic templates that may not fit our needs.

In this step, we use the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform to document all seven design factors, drawing on the enterprise context we established in Step 1 and the capability gaps we identified in Step 2. The platform guides us through each design factor with clear prompts and helps us articulate our organization's specific circumstances. This documented design factor analysis becomes a reference point for all subsequent governance decisions—when we select governance objectives in Step 4, design processes in Step 5, or set maturity targets in Step 6, we'll refer back to these design factors to ensure our choices align with our organizational context. The design factors transform governance implementation from a checklist exercise into a strategic, context-aware design process that delivers a governance framework optimized for your organization's unique needs, constraints, and opportunities.

### Bullet Points:

- **Enterprise Strategy**: Document how IT supports business direction, competitive positioning, and strategic goals—influences governance priorities and investment focus
- **Enterprise Goals Alignment**: Translate enterprise goals into IT governance priorities using the goals cascade from Step 1—ensures governance delivers business value
- **Risk Profile**: Define organizational risk appetite and key risk concerns—determines maturity targets for risk and security-related governance objectives
- **IT Role Classification**: Classify IT as Support, Factory, Turnaround, or Strategic—determines governance intensity and focus areas
- **Compliance Requirements**: List regulatory, legal, and industry obligations (GDPR, SOX, PCI-DSS, etc.)—identifies mandatory governance controls
- **Threat Landscape**: Assess cybersecurity threats and vulnerabilities organization faces—shapes security governance priorities and maturity targets
- **Technology Adoption**: Define approach to emerging technologies and innovation—influences governance for innovation, architecture, and change management
- **Context-Aware Customization**: Use design factors to tailor COBIT framework to organizational reality rather than generic templates

## Slide 2: Application by the Model Company

### Slide Title: TechCorp Financial Services - Design Factors Analysis

### Slide Notes:

TechCorp Financial Services approached the design factors analysis systematically, recognizing that their unique context as a $3.2B financial services organization requires governance tailored to their specific circumstances. The CIO convened a cross-functional team including strategy, risk management, compliance, IT architecture, and business unit representatives to analyze each design factor thoroughly. Over three weeks, they documented their organizational context across all seven COBIT design factors, creating a comprehensive foundation for governance customization.

**Enterprise Strategy Design Factor**

TechCorp's enterprise strategy centers on digital transformation to become a leading online financial services provider. They are expanding mobile banking capabilities to capture younger demographics, launching fintech partnerships to accelerate innovation, modernizing legacy core banking systems that have become technical debt, and leveraging AI and machine learning for personalized customer experiences and advanced fraud detection. This strategy positions IT not as a support function but as a strategic enabler and core business differentiator. The digital-first strategy drives governance priorities toward innovation management, architecture governance, security, and portfolio management—TechCorp needs governance that enables speed and innovation while maintaining the controls and stability expected in financial services.

**Enterprise Goals Alignment Design Factor**

Drawing on the 13 enterprise goals selected in Step 1, TechCorp documented how these goals cascade to IT governance priorities. Financial perspective goals (managed risk, compliance) demand robust governance and risk management frameworks with high maturity targets for EDM03 (Risk Optimization), APO12 (Risk Management), and MEA03 (Compliance). Customer perspective goals (agility, service excellence) require flexible IT architecture and responsive change management, influencing governance for APO03 (Enterprise Architecture) and DSS02 (Service Management). Internal process goals (optimization, quality management information) prioritize cybersecurity investments, pointing to high maturity requirements for APO13 (Security) and DSS05 (Security Services). Learning and growth goals (innovation culture, skilled people) support emerging technology adoption and talent management, influencing governance for APO04 (Innovation) and APO07 (Human Resources). This explicit linkage between enterprise goals and IT governance priorities ensures that governance investments deliver measurable business value rather than being compliance exercises disconnected from strategy.

**Risk Profile Design Factor**

As a regulated financial institution, TechCorp has a conservative risk appetite driven by fiduciary responsibilities and regulatory oversight. Their risk profile analysis identified five primary risk concerns that governance must address. First, cyber threats and data breaches—as a high-value target, TechCorp faces sophisticated attacks from organized crime and state-sponsored actors, requiring world-class cybersecurity governance. Second, operational disruptions to banking services—99.95% availability is an enterprise goal, so governance must ensure business continuity and disaster recovery. Third, regulatory non-compliance penalties—violations of SOX, GDPR, PCI-DSS, or banking regulations could result in fines, sanctions, and reputational damage. Fourth, fraud and financial crimes—both external fraud (account takeovers, payment fraud) and internal fraud risks require strong controls. Fifth, third-party vendor risks—reliance on cloud providers, fintech partners, and service providers creates supply chain risks requiring vendor governance. This conservative risk profile with multiple high-stakes risk concerns drives TechCorp to target higher maturity levels (4-5) for all risk and security-related governance objectives, accepting that this requires significant investment but recognizing that the cost of risk materialization far exceeds governance investment.

**IT Role Design Factor**

TechCorp classified their IT role as "Strategic"—IT is critical for both current operations and future strategy. With 75% of customer interactions occurring through digital channels, IT is not merely supporting the business; IT **is** the business in many respects. This strategic IT role has profound implications for governance. Organizations where IT is a support function can accept lower governance maturity and reactive approaches. Organizations like TechCorp, where IT is strategic, must invest heavily in proactive governance, innovation management, portfolio optimization, and architecture governance. The strategic IT role justifies targeting average capability maturity of 4.0 (Predictable) across governance objectives, significantly higher than the 2.0-3.0 typical of support-role IT organizations. It also drives governance focus toward value delivery, benefits realization, and strategic alignment rather than just operational efficiency and cost control.

**Compliance Requirements Design Factor**

TechCorp documented six major compliance obligations that shape governance requirements. SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act) mandates internal controls over financial reporting, influencing MEA02 (Internal Controls). GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation) requires data protection and privacy governance, driving APO14 (Data Management) and DSS06 (Business Process Controls). PCI-DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard) mandates security controls for payment card data, influencing APO13 (Security) and DSS05 (Security Services). GLBA (Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act) requires financial privacy protections. FFIEC (Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council) guidelines cover IT examination, cybersecurity, and resilience. Basel III imposes capital requirements influenced by operational risk, including IT risk. These compliance obligations are non-negotiable—TechCorp cannot choose to deprioritize these requirements. This design factor directly translates to minimum maturity requirements for compliance-related governance objectives and mandatory implementation of specific controls regardless of other prioritization considerations.

**Threat Landscape Design Factor**

TechCorp operates in a hostile threat environment as a high-value target. They face five categories of threats. Ransomware attacks targeting financial services have increased 400% in recent years; a successful attack could cripple operations and demand millions in ransom. Phishing and social engineering attacks targeting employees with privileged access are constant; employee security awareness is a critical defense. State-sponsored Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) actors target financial institutions for espionage and potential sabotage; TechCorp detected 47 APT-attributed probes last year. DDoS (Distributed Denial of Service) threats against online banking infrastructure could deny customer access during peak periods. Insider threats from employees, contractors, or vendors with privileged access represent both intentional malicious activity and unintentional security compromises. This severe threat landscape drives TechCorp to target maturity level 5 (Optimizing) for APO13 (Managed Security) and DSS05 (Security Services), recognizing that security is not a one-time implementation but requires continuous improvement, threat intelligence integration, and proactive threat hunting.

**Technology Adoption Design Factor**

TechCorp is pursuing aggressive technology modernization while managing the complexity of legacy systems. They have adopted a cloud-first strategy with a hybrid deployment model—new applications cloud-native, legacy systems gradually migrated. AI and machine learning initiatives are underway for fraud detection, customer service chatbots, credit risk analytics, and personalized recommendations. Zero-trust security architecture is being implemented to replace perimeter-based security models. API-driven microservices are gradually replacing monolithic core banking systems through a strangler fig pattern. DevSecOps practices enable continuous delivery with security built into the pipeline rather than bolted on. This technology adoption posture—aggressive innovation combined with legacy system constraints—creates specific governance needs: strong architecture governance to prevent technology sprawl, robust change management to handle increased deployment frequency, innovation governance to evaluate emerging technologies, and security governance to address new cloud and API attack surfaces. The technology adoption factor influences governance for APO03 (Architecture), APO04 (Innovation), BAI06 (Manage Changes), and DSS05 (Security Services).

### TechCorp Design Factors Summary:

| **Design Factor** | **TechCorp Analysis** | **Governance Implications** |
|--------------------|----------------------|------------------------------|
| **Enterprise Strategy** | Digital transformation to online financial services leader; mobile banking, fintech partnerships, AI/ML, legacy modernization | High priority for innovation, architecture, security, portfolio management governance |
| **Enterprise Goals Alignment** | 13 goals across 4 BSC perspectives: managed risk, compliance, agility, security, innovation | Drives maturity targets: Risk/Security (4-5), Architecture (4), Innovation (3-4) |
| **Risk Profile** | Conservative appetite; 5 key concerns: cyber threats, operational disruptions, compliance, fraud, vendor risks | Justifies targeting maturity 4-5 for all risk and security objectives |
| **IT Role** | Strategic—IT critical for current and future business | Justifies average maturity target 4.0; focus on value delivery and strategic alignment |
| **Compliance Requirements** | 6 major obligations: SOX, GDPR, PCI-DSS, GLBA, FFIEC, Basel III | Minimum maturity requirements for compliance objectives; mandatory controls |
| **Threat Landscape** | Hostile environment: ransomware, phishing, APT actors, DDoS, insider threats | Drives maturity 5 target for APO13 (Security) and DSS05 (Security Services) |
| **Technology Adoption** | Cloud-first, AI/ML, zero-trust, microservices, DevSecOps; managing legacy constraints | Strong governance needed for APO03 (Architecture), APO04 (Innovation), BAI06 (Changes) |

## Slide 3: Video Demo Narrative

### Video Title: Documenting COBIT Design Factors in the COBIT 2019 Platform

### Video Notes:

Welcome to our demonstration of Step 3: Governance Design using COBIT Design Factors in the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. In this session, we'll walk through how TechCorp Financial Services documented all seven COBIT design factors, creating a customization foundation that guides governance framework tailoring in subsequent steps. Let's begin by navigating to Step 3: Governance Design from the main dashboard.

**Enterprise Context Summary**

The platform first presents an Enterprise Context summary card at the top of the page, providing helpful context from Step 1. We can see TechCorp's organization profile at a glance: Organization name "TechCorp Financial Services Inc.", Industry "Banking and Financial Technology", Size "8,500 employees, $3.2B annual revenue", and IT Role "Strategic enabler and core business differentiator for digital banking". Below this, the summary shows "13 goals selected across 4 BSC perspectives", reminding us of the enterprise goals we selected in Step 1. This context summary is valuable because it keeps our enterprise reality front-of-mind as we document design factors, ensuring our analysis remains grounded in TechCorp's specific circumstances rather than generic descriptions.

**COBIT 2019 Design Factors Section**

Scrolling down, we see the main section titled "COBIT 2019 Design Factors" with explanatory text: "Design factors help you customize the COBIT framework to your specific context. These factors influence which governance and management objectives are most relevant to your organization." The platform presents seven numbered design factors, each with a label, helper text, and input field. Let's work through each factor systematically to document TechCorp's governance context.

**Design Factor 1: Enterprise Strategy**

The first field is labeled "Enterprise Strategy" with helper text "Describe your organization's strategic direction and how IT supports it." We click into the large textarea and begin typing TechCorp's strategy: "Digital transformation to become a leading online financial services provider. Expanding mobile banking capabilities, launching fintech partnerships, modernizing legacy core banking systems, and leveraging AI/ML for personalized customer experiences and fraud detection." The platform provides a placeholder example to guide our input. We can see our text appearing in the textarea as we type. This strategic description captures TechCorp's digital-first direction and positions IT as central to business strategy rather than a support function.

**Design Factor 2: Enterprise Goals Alignment**

Moving to the second factor, we see "Enterprise Goals Alignment" with helper text "How do your selected enterprise goals translate to IT governance priorities?" We click into this textarea and document: "Financial goals (managed risk, compliance) drive robust governance and risk management frameworks. Customer goals (agility) require flexible IT architecture. Internal goals (managed security) prioritize cybersecurity investments. Learning goals (innovation) support emerging technology adoption." This field creates an explicit linkage between the 13 enterprise goals we selected in Step 1 and the IT governance priorities we'll focus on. The platform's design encourages us to think through this cascade systematically rather than making assumptions.

**Design Factor 3: Risk Profile**

The third factor, "Risk Profile", asks "Describe your organization's risk appetite and key risk concerns." We document TechCorp's conservative risk posture: "Conservative risk appetite due to regulatory oversight and fiduciary responsibilities. Primary risk concerns: cyber threats and data breaches, operational disruptions to banking services, regulatory non-compliance penalties, fraud and financial crimes, third-party vendor risks." This risk profile description will directly influence which governance objectives we prioritize and what maturity levels we target—organizations with high-risk profiles typically need higher governance maturity than those with low-risk profiles.

**Design Factor 4: IT Role Classification**

The fourth factor is different—instead of a textarea, we see a dropdown selector labeled "Role of IT" with helper text "Define IT's strategic role: Support, Factory, Turnaround, or Strategic." We click the dropdown and see four options: "Support - Enables current operations", "Factory - Critical for current operations", "Turnaround - Important for future strategy", and "Strategic - Critical for current and future strategy." We select "Strategic" because IT is absolutely critical for both TechCorp's current banking operations and future digital transformation strategy. This IT role classification is one of the most important design factors because it fundamentally shapes governance intensity and investment levels.

**Design Factor 5: Compliance Requirements**

The fifth factor, "Compliance Requirements", is also interactive in a different way. We see helper text "List regulatory and compliance obligations (e.g., GDPR, SOX, PCI-DSS)" along with an input field and an "Add" button. This design allows us to build a list of compliance requirements rather than writing them in a paragraph. We click the input field and type our first requirement: "SOX (Sarbanes-Oxley Act)". We click the Add button, and the requirement appears as a teal-colored tag below the input field with an × button to remove it. We continue adding compliance requirements one by one: "GDPR (Data Protection)", "PCI-DSS (Payment Card Security)", "GLBA (Financial Privacy)", "FFIEC Guidelines", and "Basel III (Capital Requirements)". The platform now displays all six compliance obligations as clickable tags. This visual presentation makes it immediately clear how many regulatory obligations TechCorp must address—a key input to governance prioritization.

**Design Factor 6: Threat Landscape**

The sixth factor is "Threat Landscape" with helper text "Describe the threat environment your organization faces." We document the hostile environment TechCorp operates in: "High-value target for cybercriminals and organized crime. Increasing sophistication in ransomware, phishing, and social engineering attacks. State-sponsored APT (Advanced Persistent Threat) actors targeting financial sector. DDoS threats against online banking infrastructure. Insider threats from privileged access." This threat landscape analysis directly influences security governance priorities and maturity targets—the more hostile the threat environment, the higher the security governance maturity required.

**Design Factor 7: Technology Adoption**

The seventh and final factor is "Technology Adoption" with helper text "Describe your organization's approach to new technologies." We document TechCorp's modernization journey: "Cloud-first strategy with hybrid deployment model. Adopting AI/ML for fraud detection, customer service chatbots, and risk analytics. Implementing zero-trust security architecture. API-driven microservices replacing monolithic systems. DevSecOps practices for continuous delivery." This technology adoption description captures both the innovation TechCorp is pursuing and the legacy constraints they must manage, influencing governance for architecture, change management, and innovation.

**Design Recommendations Panel**

After completing all seven design factors, we scroll down to see an automatically generated "Design Recommendations" panel. This blue-highlighted card displays recommended COBIT objectives based on our design factor inputs. The platform shows four columns for different COBIT domains. Under "Governance (EDM)", we see EDM01 (Governance Framework) marked as Essential, EDM03 (Risk Optimization) as High priority, and EDM02 (Benefits Delivery) as Recommended. Under "Align, Plan, Organize (APO)", we see APO12 (Managed Risk), APO13 (Managed Security), and APO01 (IT Management Framework). Under "Deliver, Service, Support (DSS)", we see DSS05 (Security Services) and DSS04 (Managed Continuity). Under "Monitor, Evaluate, Assess (MEA)", we see MEA03 (Compliance Management) and MEA01 (Performance Monitoring). These recommendations provide intelligent guidance based on TechCorp's documented design factors—for example, the conservative risk profile, strategic IT role, and hostile threat landscape drive the high priority for risk and security objectives.

**Saving the Design Factors**

We scroll to the bottom of the page where we see a "Save Governance Design" button with a save icon. We click this button to save all seven design factors we've documented. The platform confirms successful save, and these design factors are now stored as part of TechCorp's governance context. If we navigate back to the dashboard, we can see that Step 3 is marked as complete. The documented design factors become reference material for all subsequent governance decisions—when we select governance objectives in Step 4, prioritize processes in Step 5, or set maturity targets in Step 6, we'll refer back to these design factors to ensure our choices align with TechCorp's specific context.

The COBIT design factors approach transforms governance implementation from generic template application into strategic, context-aware customization. Rather than implementing all 40 COBIT objectives at the same maturity level, TechCorp can now make intelligent choices about which objectives matter most, what maturity levels to target, and how to sequence implementation—all grounded in systematic analysis of their organizational reality documented in these seven design factors.
