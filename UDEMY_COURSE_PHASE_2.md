# STEP 4: GOVERNANCE OBJECTIVES (EDM)

## Slide 1: Step Overview

### Slide Title: Defining Governance Objectives - The Core of Strategic Oversight

### Slide Notes:

Step 4 marks our entry into the core of COBIT implementation by selecting and configuring Governance Objectives from the EDM domain. EDM stands for Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor—the three fundamental activities that governance bodies perform. These five governance objectives represent the apex of the COBIT framework, focusing on what the Board and executive leadership must do to ensure IT delivers value, optimizes risk, manages resources effectively, and engages stakeholders appropriately. While management objectives in subsequent steps focus on day-to-day execution, governance objectives focus on oversight, direction-setting, and strategic decision-making. Understanding this distinction is critical—governance is about setting direction and ensuring accountability, while management is about executing that direction.

The five EDM governance objectives are EDM01 through EDM05. EDM01, Ensured Governance Framework Setting and Maintenance, focuses on establishing and maintaining the governance system itself—defining structures, processes, roles, and ensuring the framework remains effective and relevant. EDM02, Ensured Benefits Delivery, ensures that IT investments deliver promised business value through portfolio management, benefits realization tracking, and value optimization. EDM03, Ensured Risk Optimization, provides oversight of IT-related risks, ensuring risk appetite is defined, risk management is effective, and risks are balanced with opportunities. EDM04, Ensured Resource Optimization, ensures IT resources including budget, people, and infrastructure are optimized to support strategic objectives. EDM05, Ensured Stakeholder Engagement, ensures transparent communication and relationship management with all stakeholders who have interest in or are affected by IT decisions.

Each governance objective contains multiple practices that describe specific activities governance bodies should perform. These practices follow the Evaluate-Direct-Monitor pattern. Evaluate practices involve assessing current state, reviewing performance, and identifying gaps. Direct practices involve setting direction, approving policies and frameworks, and making strategic decisions. Monitor practices involve ongoing oversight, tracking of metrics, and ensuring that direction is being followed. For example, EDM03 (Risk Optimization) includes practices to evaluate the IT risk profile, direct the risk management approach and appetite, and monitor risk management effectiveness through regular reporting and metrics review.

Organizations must decide which governance objectives to enable and how intensively to implement them based on the governance context defined in Step 1 and capability gaps identified in Step 2. In most cases, all five EDM objectives should be enabled because they represent the fundamental responsibilities of governance bodies. However, the maturity level targeted and the specific practices implemented may vary based on organizational context. A small organization with simple IT may implement these objectives at a basic level, while a large, complex, highly regulated organization may implement them very intensively with sophisticated processes, extensive documentation, and continuous monitoring. The key is proportionality—governance should be fit-for-purpose, neither over-engineered nor inadequate. Step 4 is where we make these configuration decisions explicit, selecting which objectives to enable, defining target capability levels, and identifying the specific practices we will implement.

### Bullet Points:

- **EDM Domain Focus**: Select and configure the 5 governance objectives (EDM01-EDM05) that define Board and executive oversight responsibilities
- **Evaluate-Direct-Monitor Pattern**: Each objective contains practices following the EDM pattern of assessing current state, setting direction, and monitoring execution
- **Strategic vs. Operational Distinction**: Governance objectives focus on oversight and direction-setting, distinct from management objectives that focus on execution
- **EDM01 - Governance Framework**: Establish and maintain the governance system itself, ensuring it remains effective and relevant to organizational needs

## Slide 2: Application by the Model Company

### Slide Title: TechCorp Financial Services - Enabling All Governance Objectives

### Slide Notes:

TechCorp Financial Services made the strategic decision to enable all five EDM governance objectives with high priority and ambitious target capability levels. This decision reflects TechCorp's context as a highly regulated financial services organization where governance is not optional but a regulatory expectation and business imperative. The Board and executive leadership recognized that robust governance oversight is essential for managing the complexity, risk, and regulatory obligations inherent in their business. Let's examine how TechCorp configured each governance objective and the specific practices they implemented.

EDM01, Ensured Governance Framework Setting and Maintenance, was prioritized as foundational. TechCorp implemented all three practices. For EDM01.01 (Evaluate the Governance System), they established an annual governance effectiveness review conducted by the Board, supported by quarterly governance metrics reviews, annual independent governance audits, stakeholder satisfaction surveys, and peer benchmarking against industry standards. This practice ensures governance doesn't become stale or disconnected from business needs. For EDM01.02 (Direct the Governance System), the Board approved a comprehensive Governance Charter defining principles, structures, decision rights, and escalation procedures. The IT Steering Committee charter delegates specific authorities while reserving strategic decisions for the Board. For EDM01.03 (Monitor the Governance System), TechCorp established monthly governance dashboards to the Board, governance control self-assessments, exception reporting with resolution tracking, and continuous improvement initiatives. The status of all three practices is "Implemented," reflecting the maturity of TechCorp's governance framework foundation.

EDM02, Ensured Benefits Delivery, addressed TechCorp's critical gap identified in capability assessment—the lack of systematic benefits realization. All three practices are being implemented. EDM02.01 (Evaluate Value Optimization) includes quarterly portfolio value reviews, business case assessment and validation, value realization tracking for major initiatives, and investment performance benchmarking. EDM02.02 (Direct Value Optimization) involves portfolio prioritization based on strategic value, resource allocation aligned with value drivers, establishment of benefits realization targets, and launch of value optimization initiatives. EDM02.03 (Monitor Value Optimization) is marked "In Progress" with a benefits realization tracking system being implemented in Q3 2024, mandatory post-implementation reviews for all major projects, value metrics dashboards under development, and corrective actions for underperforming investments. This phased implementation acknowledges that building benefits realization capability takes time but is essential for stakeholder confidence.

EDM03, Ensured Risk Optimization, leverages TechCorp's relatively mature risk management capabilities. All three practices are implemented. EDM03.01 (Evaluate Risk Management) includes quarterly IT risk appetite reviews, risk assessments aligned with the enterprise risk management framework, regular review of risk metrics and key risk indicators, and independent risk assessments. EDM03.02 (Direct Risk Management) involves Board approval of the IT risk appetite statement, establishment of risk management frameworks and policies, implementation of a three lines of defense model, and risk culture and awareness programs. EDM03.03 (Monitor Risk Management) includes monthly risk dashboards to the Technology Risk Committee, continuous monitoring of key risk indicators, risk incident tracking with root cause analysis, and regular deep-dives on critical risk areas. TechCorp's status as "Implemented" for all EDM03 practices reflects years of regulatory focus on risk management in financial services.

EDM04, Ensured Resource Optimization, is at medium priority with mixed implementation status. EDM04.01 (Evaluate Resource Management) is marked "Planned" for Q4 2024, involving annual resource allocation reviews, capacity planning assessments, resource utilization analytics, and cloud spend optimization reviews. EDM04.02 (Direct Resource Management) is implemented with annual IT budget approval including strategic allocation, resource optimization targets (10% cost reduction), establishment of cloud FinOps principles, and strategic workforce planning. EDM04.03 (Monitor Resource Management) is "In Progress" with monthly budget variance analysis already operational, resource utilization dashboards being implemented, cloud cost monitoring and chargebacks being established, and skills gap analysis underway. This phased approach acknowledges that resource optimization, while important, comes after getting the governance framework, benefits delivery, and risk management foundations in place.

EDM05, Ensured Stakeholder Engagement, addresses the gap in systematic stakeholder relationship management. EDM05.01 (Evaluate Stakeholder Engagement) is "In Progress" with annual stakeholder satisfaction surveys, stakeholder needs assessment workshops, communication effectiveness reviews, and engagement maturity assessments being established. EDM05.02 (Direct Stakeholder Communication) is implemented with a stakeholder communication strategy and plan, governance reporting framework, stakeholder escalation procedures, and transparent decision-making processes. EDM05.03 (Monitor Stakeholder Engagement) is implemented with quarterly stakeholder relationship reviews, feedback collection and action tracking, engagement metrics dashboards, and continuous improvement based on stakeholder input. TechCorp recognizes that stakeholder satisfaction directly impacts governance effectiveness and has made this a high priority.

### TechCorp EDM Objectives Configuration:

| **Objective** | **Status** | **Priority** | **Current Level** | **Target Level** | **Key Practices Implemented** |
|---------------|------------|--------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------------------------|

## Slide 3: Video Demo Narrative

### Video Title: Configuring Governance Objectives in the COBIT 2019 Platform

### Video Notes:

Welcome to the demonstration of Step 4: Governance Objectives in the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. In this walkthrough, we'll configure the five EDM governance objectives for TechCorp Financial Services, defining which objectives to enable and tracking which practices are implemented. Let's navigate to Step 4: Governance Objectives from the main dashboard. The platform displays all five EDM objectives in a structured view: EDM01 through EDM05. Each objective shows a toggle for Enabled/Disabled and an expandable section to view practices and track implementation.

We start with EDM01: Ensured Governance Framework Setting and Maintenance. We click the toggle to enable this objective—it switches from gray to blue, indicating it's active. This foundational objective is essential because it establishes and maintains the governance system itself. We click to expand the Practices section, and we see three practices: EDM01.01 (Evaluate the Governance System), EDM01.02 (Direct the Governance System), and EDM01.03 (Monitor the Governance System), each following the Evaluate-Direct-Monitor pattern.

For EDM01.01 (Evaluate the Governance System), we see the practice description displayed: "Continually examine and evaluate the current and future needs of the governance system." We can mark this practice as implemented by checking the implementation checkbox, indicating that TechCorp has established this practice through annual governance effectiveness reviews by the Board and assessment against the COBIT framework. We do the same for EDM01.02 (Direct the Governance System), marking it implemented to reflect that the Board approves the governance charter, establishes the IT Steering Committee, and defines delegation of authority. For EDM01.03 (Monitor the Governance System), we check the implementation box to indicate the monthly governance dashboard to the Board and governance control self-assessments are in place.

Now we move to EDM02: Ensured Benefits Delivery. We enable this objective because it addresses a critical gap identified in our capability assessment—TechCorp had no systematic benefits realization process. We expand the practices section and see the three practices: EDM02.01 (Evaluate Value Optimization), EDM02.02 (Direct Value Optimization), and EDM02.03 (Monitor Value Optimization). We mark EDM02.01 and EDM02.02 as implemented, reflecting TechCorp's quarterly portfolio value reviews and portfolio prioritization based on strategic value. However, we leave EDM02.03 unchecked because the benefits realization tracking system is still implementing in Q3 2024—the value metrics dashboard is under development and the corrective actions process for underperforming investments is being established. This transparency ensures everyone understands that EDM02 is enabled and high priority, but practices are still maturing.

We continue with EDM03: Ensured Risk Optimization. We enable this objective, recognizing that TechCorp's risk management is relatively mature. All three practices—EDM03.01 (Evaluate the IT Risk Profile), EDM03.02 (Direct IT Risk Management), and EDM03.03 (Monitor IT Risk Management)—are marked as implemented, reflecting TechCorp's quarterly IT risk appetite reviews, Board-approved risk appetite statement, and monthly risk dashboards to the Technology Risk Committee.

For EDM04: Ensured Resource Optimization, we enable it, acknowledging that while resource optimization is important, TechCorp has prioritized governance framework, benefits delivery, and risk management first. When we expand practices, we see that EDM04.02 (Direct Resource Management) is marked implemented with annual IT budget approval and cloud FinOps principles in place. However, EDM04.01 (Evaluate Resource Management) and EDM04.03 (Monitor Resource Management) remain unchecked as these capabilities are still being developed, with annual resource allocation reviews scheduled for Q4 2024 and resource utilization dashboards under implementation.

Finally, we configure EDM05: Ensured Stakeholder Engagement, enabling it to address TechCorp's stakeholder relationship management gap. We mark EDM05.02 (Direct Stakeholder Communication) and EDM05.03 (Monitor Stakeholder Engagement) as implemented, reflecting the stakeholder communication strategy, governance reporting framework, and quarterly relationship reviews that are operational. However, EDM05.01 (Evaluate Stakeholder Engagement) remains unchecked as the comprehensive stakeholder satisfaction surveys and engagement maturity assessments are still being established.

With all five EDM objectives configured, the platform generates a summary dashboard. We see that all 5 governance objectives are enabled, representing 15 practices total. The platform shows the percentage of practices implemented, giving leadership a clear view of governance implementation maturity. We can see which practices are marked as implemented and which remain to be developed, providing transparency into TechCorp's governance readiness. This summary is valuable for governance reporting and stakeholder communication.

The IT Steering Committee reviews TechCorp's governance objectives configuration to ensure alignment with governance expectations. During the review, there's discussion about implementation priorities and resource constraints. The committee acknowledges that full governance maturity is a multi-year journey. They approve the configuration as documented with the understanding that implementation will be phased, prioritizing objectives and practices marked as critical gaps in the capability assessment. This approved configuration guides our implementation activities, budget allocation, and resource planning as we move forward with building out governance capabilities across the five EDM objectives.

# STEP 5: MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES SELECTION

## Slide 1: Step Overview

### Slide Title: Selecting Management Objectives - Building the Execution Framework

### Slide Notes:

Step 5 shifts focus from governance oversight to management execution by selecting Management Objectives from the four management domains of COBIT 2019. While the five EDM governance objectives focus on what the Board and executive leadership oversee, the 35 management objectives describe what IT management must execute to deliver services, manage risks, build solutions, and operate effectively. These management objectives span four domains, each representing a different aspect of IT management's responsibilities. APO, Align Plan and Organize, contains 14 objectives covering strategic planning, architecture, portfolio management, budget, vendors, and foundational capabilities. BAI, Build Acquire and Implement, contains 11 objectives covering how we develop, acquire, and deploy IT solutions. DSS, Deliver Service and Support, contains 6 objectives covering day-to-day IT operations and service delivery. MEA, Monitor Evaluate and Assess, contains 4 objectives covering performance monitoring, controls, compliance, and assurance.

Organizations face a critical decision in Step 5: which of these 35 management objectives to enable. Unlike governance objectives where most organizations enable all five EDM objectives, management objectives require more selective decision-making. Enabling an objective means committing to implement its practices, assign accountabilities, establish processes, measure performance, and allocate resources. Few organizations have the capacity to implement all 35 objectives simultaneously at high maturity. Therefore, selection must be strategic, driven by the governance context defined in Step 1, capability gaps identified in Step 2, and priorities established through governance structures in Steps 3 and 4. The selection criteria typically include: alignment with enterprise goals, addressing high-priority capability gaps, managing critical risks, meeting regulatory requirements, supporting strategic initiatives, and stakeholder needs.

Each management objective contains multiple practices describing specific activities that must be performed. The number of practices varies by objective—some have 3-4 practices while others have 6-7. Each practice includes management activities, work products, inputs, and outputs. When we enable a management objective, we're committing to implement its practices, though not necessarily all at once or at the same maturity level. Organizations typically implement objectives in waves—starting with highest priority objectives and gradually expanding coverage. Some objectives may be enabled at basic maturity (level 2) while others are targeted for high maturity (level 4-5) based on their criticality. This differentiated approach allows organizations to focus resources where they matter most while still maintaining baseline capabilities across the broader set of objectives.

The selection process should be data-driven and stakeholder-informed. We review enterprise goals from Step 1 and identify which management objectives directly support those goals. We review capability assessment gaps from Step 2 and prioritize objectives with significant gaps and high business impact. We consider risk profile and compliance requirements—a highly regulated organization needs strong compliance and risk management objectives, while an innovation-focused organization prioritizes portfolio management and change enablement objectives. We engage stakeholders identified in Step 1 to ensure their needs are addressed. The outcome is a prioritized list of management objectives to enable, with clear rationale for each decision and explicit acknowledgment of objectives not enabled or deferred. This transparency prevents unrealistic expectations and ensures governance bodies approve a realistic, achievable management framework rather than an aspirational wish list that overwhelms IT management and fails in execution.

### Bullet Points:

- **35 Management Objectives**: Select from comprehensive set spanning Align/Plan/Organize, Build/Acquire/Implement, Deliver/Service/Support, and Monitor/Evaluate/Assess domains
- **Strategic Selection**: Not all objectives need to be enabled; select based on enterprise goals, capability gaps, risks, compliance requirements, and resource capacity
- **APO Domain (14 objectives)**: Strategic alignment, planning, architecture, portfolio, budget, vendors, relationships, quality, risk, security, data management
- **BAI Domain (11 objectives)**: Requirements, solution delivery, availability, capacity, change management, configuration, project management, knowledge management
- **DSS Domain (6 objectives)**: Operations, incidents, problems, business continuity, security operations, business process controls
- **MEA Domain (4 objectives)**: Performance monitoring, internal controls, regulatory compliance, independent assurance and audit
- **Prioritization Framework**: Use enterprise goals, capability gaps, risk profile, and stakeholder needs to prioritize which objectives to enable and at what maturity
- **Phased Implementation**: Implement objectives in waves, starting with highest priority and critical gaps, expanding coverage over time

## Slide 2: Application by the Model Company

### Slide Title: TechCorp Financial Services - Strategic Management Objectives Selection

### Slide Notes:

TechCorp Financial Services conducted a rigorous process to select management objectives, ultimately enabling 32 of the 35 available objectives, representing 80% coverage. This high enablement rate reflects TechCorp's size, complexity, regulatory environment, and strategic importance of IT. The selection process took four weeks, involving IT leadership, process owners, business stakeholders, risk management, and compliance. They used a scoring framework evaluating each objective against five criteria: alignment with the 13 enterprise goals, capability gaps and improvement priority, risk mitigation contribution, regulatory compliance requirements, and stakeholder needs. Each criterion was weighted and objectives were scored, producing a prioritized list that was reviewed and approved by the IT Steering Committee.

In the APO domain, TechCorp enabled 13 of 14 objectives. APO01 (Managed IT Management Framework) was enabled at high priority to establish an integrated management approach and formalize process governance. APO02 (Managed Strategy) was enabled at high priority to align IT strategy with enterprise strategy and digital transformation objectives. APO03 (Managed Enterprise Architecture) was enabled at medium priority to establish architecture standards and technical roadmaps. APO04 (Managed Innovation) was enabled at medium priority to foster innovation culture and manage innovation portfolios, though TechCorp acknowledged this is nascent capability. APO05 (Managed Portfolio) was enabled at high priority given the need for portfolio optimization and the critical gap in benefits realization identified in capability assessment.

APO06 (Managed Budget and Costs) was enabled at high priority for financial management, budgeting, and cost optimization—essential for demonstrating IT value to the CFO. APO07 (Managed Human Resources) was enabled at high priority due to the 14% turnover rate and critical need for talent acquisition, development, and retention. APO08 (Managed Relationships) was enabled at medium priority for business relationship management. APO09 (Managed Service Agreements) was enabled at medium priority for SLA definition and management. APO10 (Managed Vendors) was enabled at high priority given TechCorp's extensive vendor ecosystem of 200+ vendors requiring active management. APO11 (Managed Quality) was enabled at medium priority for quality management system and continuous improvement. APO12 (Managed Risk) and APO13 (Managed Security) were both enabled at high priority with ambitious target levels of 5, reflecting the critical importance of risk and security in financial services. The one APO objective not enabled was APO14 (Managed Data)—TechCorp plans to enable this in Phase 2 expansion in Q1 2025 once foundational governance and portfolio capabilities are mature.

In the BAI domain, TechCorp enabled 9 of 11 objectives. BAI01 (Managed Programs) was enabled at medium priority for program governance. BAI02 (Managed Requirements Definition) was enabled at medium priority to improve requirements quality and reduce defects. BAI03 (Managed Solutions Identification and Build) was enabled at high priority, leveraging TechCorp's relatively mature Agile development practices. BAI04 (Managed Availability and Capacity) was enabled at high priority to ensure the 99.95% availability target for digital banking platforms. BAI06 (Managed IT Changes) was enabled at high priority given the critical importance of change management in production environments. BAI07 (Managed Change Acceptance and Transitioning) was enabled at medium priority to improve deployment success rates.

BAI09 (Managed Assets) was enabled at medium priority for IT asset management. BAI10 (Managed Configuration) was enabled at high priority to improve CMDB accuracy from 87% to 95%, supporting incident resolution and change management. BAI11 (Managed Projects) was enabled at high priority to improve the 73% on-time delivery rate. The two BAI objectives not enabled were BAI05 (Managed Organizational Change) and BAI08 (Managed Knowledge)—TechCorp acknowledged these gaps but decided to defer them to Phase 2, focusing first on technical delivery capabilities before expanding to organizational change and knowledge management.

In the DSS domain, TechCorp enabled all 6 objectives, recognizing that operational service delivery is non-negotiable for a financial services firm where 75% of customer interactions are digital. DSS01 (Managed Operations) was enabled at high priority for IT operations management and service delivery. DSS02 (Managed Service Requests and Incidents) was enabled at high priority, building on TechCorp's mature ServiceNow ITSM platform. DSS03 (Managed Problems) was enabled at medium priority for problem management and root cause analysis. DSS04 (Managed Continuity) was enabled at high priority for business continuity and disaster recovery, targeting capability level 5 given the criticality of financial services availability. DSS05 (Managed Security Services) was enabled at high priority with target level 5 for security operations and 24/7 monitoring. DSS06 (Managed Business Process Controls) was enabled at high priority for business process controls and SOX compliance.

In the MEA domain, TechCorp enabled all 4 objectives at high priority, reflecting the importance of monitoring, compliance, and assurance in a regulated industry. MEA01 (Managed Performance and Conformance Monitoring) was enabled to establish comprehensive performance monitoring and reporting. MEA02 (Managed System of Internal Control) was enabled to maintain SOX compliance and internal controls over IT. MEA03 (Managed Compliance with External Requirements) was enabled with target level 5, given the extensive regulatory environment—SOX, GDPR, PCI-DSS, Basel III, NYDFS, and others. MEA04 (Managed Assurance) was enabled at medium priority for independent assurance and audits. This comprehensive MEA domain enablement ensures TechCorp can demonstrate control effectiveness and compliance to regulators, auditors, and the Board.

### TechCorp Management Objectives Selection Summary:

| **Domain** | **Total Objectives** | **Enabled** | **Not Enabled** | **High Priority** | **Medium Priority** | **Key Rationale** |
|------------|----------------------|-------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------|-------------------|
| **APO (Align/Plan/Organize)** | 14 | 13 | 1 (APO14) | 9 | 4 | Strategic alignment, portfolio, risk, security, talent management critical; Data governance deferred to 2025 |
| **BAI (Build/Acquire/Implement)** | 11 | 9 | 2 (BAI05, BAI08) | 5 | 4 | Focus on technical delivery and change management; Organizational change and knowledge deferred |
| **DSS (Deliver/Service/Support)** | 6 | 6 | 0 | 5 | 1 | All operational objectives essential for 24/7 digital banking services; No exceptions |
| **MEA (Monitor/Evaluate/Assess)** | 4 | 4 | 0 | 3 | 1 | All monitoring and compliance objectives required in regulated environment |
| **Total** | 35 | 32 (91%) | 3 (9%) | 22 | 10 | Comprehensive coverage reflecting size, complexity, and regulatory requirements |

### Deferred Objectives and Rationale:

- **APO14 (Managed Data)**: Deferred to Q1 2025; Data governance foundation being built, will enable once ready
- **BAI05 (Organizational Change)**: Deferred to Phase 2; Focus first on technical delivery, then organizational adoption
- **BAI08 (Managed Knowledge)**: Deferred to Phase 2; Knowledge management will follow once processes stabilize

## Slide 3: Video Demo Narrative

### Video Title: Selecting Management Objectives in the COBIT 2019 Platform

### Video Notes:

Welcome to our demonstration of Step 5: Management Objectives Selection in the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. This is where we build out the execution framework by selecting which of the 35 management objectives TechCorp will implement. We navigate from the dashboard to Step 5: Management Objectives. The platform displays an organized view of all 35 objectives across the four management domains: APO, BAI, DSS, and MEA. Each domain is presented as a summary card showing statistics, and we can filter and view objectives by domain. Each objective shows a toggle to enable or disable it, along with a priority dropdown. Let's work through each domain systematically.

We start with the APO domain, clicking the APO domain card to filter and view all 14 objectives. We see APO01: Managed IT Management Framework at the top of the list. We click the toggle to enable this objective—it turns blue. We set Priority to High using the dropdown menu because establishing an integrated IT management framework is foundational to everything else. The platform also shows the practices associated with this objective, providing visibility into what implementing APO01 entails.

We continue down the APO list, enabling APO02 (Managed Strategy) at high priority. We enable APO03 (Managed Enterprise Architecture) but set priority to Medium since architecture standardization, while important, is not as immediately critical as strategy, portfolio, or risk management. We enable APO04 (Managed Innovation) at medium priority—TechCorp recognizes innovation management is nascent but important for the future. We enable APO05 (Managed Portfolio) at high priority, noting this is critical for benefits realization and addressing the EDM02 gap we identified in governance objectives.

We work through APO06 through APO13, enabling each and setting appropriate priorities based on TechCorp's strategic needs. When we reach APO14 (Managed Data), we pause. TechCorp has decided not to enable this objective yet—it will be deferred to Q1 2025 when the data governance foundation being established under a separate initiative is ready. We leave the toggle disabled. This explicit decision to defer rather than enable at low priority prevents stakeholders from assuming data management is being ignored while acknowledging it's a future priority.

Moving to the BAI domain, we click the BAI domain card to view all 11 objectives. We enable BAI01 through BAI04, setting priorities based on TechCorp's assessment. BAI03 (Solutions Identification and Build) gets high priority, reflecting TechCorp's mature Agile practices that need to be maintained. BAI04 (Availability and Capacity) also gets high priority because ensuring 99.95% availability for digital banking is mission-critical. When we reach BAI05 (Organizational Change Management), we decide not to enable it yet. TechCorp has decided to focus first on technical delivery capabilities before expanding to organizational change management.

We continue enabling BAI06 (Change Management) at high priority—change management is non-negotiable in production banking systems. We enable BAI07 (Change Acceptance and Transitioning) at medium priority. We leave BAI08 (Knowledge Management) disabled, recognizing that knowledge management will be enabled once processes stabilize and there's content to manage. We enable BAI09 (Assets) at medium priority, BAI10 (Configuration) at high priority given the CMDB accuracy gap, and BAI11 (Projects) at high priority to address the 73% on-time delivery rate. The domain summary now shows 9 of 11 BAI objectives enabled.

For the DSS domain, TechCorp's decision is straightforward—enable all 6 objectives because operational service delivery is non-negotiable. We click the DSS domain card and systematically enable DSS01 through DSS06. DSS01 (Operations) gets high priority. DSS02 (Service Requests and Incidents) gets high priority, building on the mature ServiceNow ITSM platform. DSS03 (Problems) is medium priority. DSS04 (Continuity) is high priority because business continuity in financial services is existential. DSS05 (Security Services) is high priority—cybersecurity is critical for maintaining customer trust and regulatory standing. DSS06 (Business Process Controls) is high priority, supporting SOX compliance. With all DSS objectives enabled, we move to the final domain.

The MEA domain contains only 4 objectives, and TechCorp enables all of them. We click the MEA domain card and enable MEA01 (Performance and Conformance Monitoring) at high priority to establish comprehensive monitoring capabilities. We enable MEA02 (System of Internal Control) at high priority for SOX compliance. We enable MEA03 (Compliance with External Requirements) at high priority—regulatory compliance in financial services demands strong capability. We enable MEA04 (Assurance) at medium priority for independent assurance and audit support. All MEA objectives are now enabled, reflecting the importance of monitoring, compliance, and assurance in TechCorp's regulated environment.

With all domains reviewed and selections made, the platform generates a comprehensive summary view. We see statistics: 35 total objectives, 32 enabled (91%), 3 deferred (9%). We see 22 high-priority objectives and 10 medium-priority objectives—no low-priority objectives because TechCorp decided if something is low priority, it's better to defer it. The platform displays a domain breakdown showing APO: 13 of 14 enabled, BAI: 9 of 11 enabled, DSS: 6 of 6 enabled, MEA: 4 of 4 enabled. We can also see visualizations of the priority distribution across all enabled objectives.

The platform provides filtering capabilities. We can filter to show only high-priority objectives—the list narrows to 22 objectives that will be the primary focus of implementation efforts and resource allocation. We can filter by domain to focus on specific areas. These filtering options help us analyze and communicate our selections effectively.

We present TechCorp's management objectives selection to the IT Steering Committee for approval. During the committee meeting, there's robust discussion. The CFO questions whether 32 objectives is too ambitious and whether the organization has capacity to implement so many. The CIO presents the phased implementation plan—Wave 1 focuses on critical objectives addressing immediate gaps, with subsequent waves expanding coverage over time. The committee appreciates this realistic phasing and approves the selection with the understanding that implementation is multi-year.

One committee member asks about the three deferred objectives—when will they be enabled? The CIO commits to reviewing deferred objectives quarterly and presenting enablement recommendations when readiness criteria are met. The committee approves this approach. With formal approval secured, the management objectives selection is finalized. This approved set of 32 management objectives, combined with the 5 governance objectives from Step 4, forms TechCorp's complete COBIT implementation scope: 37 total objectives that will guide process definition, practice implementation, and capability building as we move into Step 6 and beyond.

# STEP 6: COMPONENT DEFINITION

## Slide 1: Step Overview

### Slide Title: Defining Governance Components - Building the Operating Model

### Slide Notes:

Step 6, Component Definition, is where we translate governance and management objectives into tangible, operational components that make up our governance operating model. Up to this point, we've defined what we want to achieve—enterprise goals, governance objectives, management objectives. Now we define how we'll achieve it—the specific organizational structures, processes, information artifacts, cultural elements, skills, and enabling technologies that bring governance to life. COBIT 2019 recognizes that achieving governance and management objectives requires more than just defining processes on paper; it requires a holistic system of components working together. These components are organized into six categories derived from COBIT's governance and management objectives structure.

The six component categories provide a comprehensive framework for operationalizing governance. First, Organizational Structures define the committees, boards, roles, and reporting relationships that provide governance and management oversight. These include boards, steering committees, working groups, governance offices, and centers of excellence. Second, Processes and Practices describe the standardized, repeatable activities that achieve governance and management objectives. These include strategic planning processes, risk assessment processes, change management processes, and performance monitoring processes. Third, Information Flows and Items encompass the data, reports, dashboards, and documentation that inform decisions and enable oversight. This includes governance dashboards, risk registers, portfolio reports, and compliance attestations.

Fourth, Culture Ethics and Behavior represent the values, norms, and behavioral expectations that shape how people act within the governance framework. This includes codes of conduct, security awareness, innovation culture, and accountability norms. Fifth, Skills and Competencies define the knowledge, capabilities, and expertise required to operate the governance system effectively. This includes technical skills, risk management competencies, architecture skills, and leadership capabilities. Sixth, Services Infrastructure and Applications are the enabling technologies and platforms that support governance activities. This includes GRC platforms, ITSM tools, monitoring systems, collaboration platforms, and reporting tools.

Defining components involves inventorying what currently exists, identifying gaps, and designing new components needed to achieve objectives. Organizations should avoid the trap of designing perfect components that look impressive on paper but are impractical to implement. Components should be pragmatic, proportionate to organizational size and complexity, and sustainable with available resources. The number of components varies by organization—a small organization might define 20-30 components while a large, complex organization might define 100+ components. What matters is not quantity but coverage—do the components collectively enable achievement of governance and management objectives? Are critical structures, processes, information, culture, skills, and technologies defined and adequately resourced?

Component definition also involves assigning ownership and accountability. Every component should have a clear owner responsible for establishing, maintaining, and improving it. Components should have defined status—planned, in progress, or completed—allowing transparent tracking of implementation progress. Some components may be shared across multiple objectives while others are specific to a single objective. The relationship between components and objectives should be explicit—for each objective, we should know which components support it, and for each component, we should know which objectives it serves. This traceability ensures components are purpose-driven rather than created for their own sake and helps justify resource allocation by demonstrating how components contribute to strategic outcomes.

### Bullet Points:

- **Six Component Categories**: Define organizational structures, processes/practices, information flows, culture/ethics, skills/competencies, and services/infrastructure/applications
- **Holistic Operating Model**: Components work together as an integrated system to achieve governance and management objectives, not isolated elements
- **Organizational Structures**: Committees, boards, working groups, governance offices, centers of excellence with clear charters and decision rights
- **Processes and Practices**: Standardized, repeatable activities that operationalize governance objectives including planning, risk management, change control, monitoring
- **Information and Reporting**: Dashboards, reports, registers, documentation that inform decisions and enable oversight at all levels
- **Culture and Behavior**: Values, norms, ethics, awareness programs that shape how people act within the governance framework
- **Skills and Competencies**: Technical capabilities, risk management knowledge, architecture expertise, leadership skills required for effective governance
- **Enabling Technology**: GRC platforms, ITSM tools, monitoring systems, collaboration platforms that support governance activities and automate workflows

## Slide 3: Video Demo Narrative

### Video Title: Documenting Governance Components in the COBIT 2019 Platform

### Video Notes:

Welcome to our demonstration of Step 6: Component Definition in the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. This is where we operationalize governance by defining the specific structures, processes, information, culture, skills, and technologies that bring our governance framework to life. We navigate to Step 6: Component Definition from the main dashboard. The platform presents an organized interface with six sections corresponding to the six component categories: Organizational Structures, Processes and Practices, Information Flows and Items, Culture Ethics and Behavior, Skills and Competencies, and Services Infrastructure and Applications. Let's work through each category systematically.

We start with Organizational Structures. We click "Add Component" and a form appears with fields for Component Name, Component Type (which we select from the dropdown as "Organizational Structures"), Description, and Status. For our first component, we enter "IT Steering Committee" as the name. In the Description field, we document: "Executive governance body for strategic IT decisions. Chaired by CEO with members including CFO, CRO, CIO, Business Unit Leaders. Meets monthly. Responsible for strategic direction, major investment approval, portfolio prioritization. Reports to Board of Directors quarterly." This comprehensive description ensures anyone reviewing the component catalog understands what this structure is and how it operates.

We set Status to "Completed" from the dropdown because the IT Steering Committee is already operational. We click Save and the IT Steering Committee component is added to our catalog. We see it listed in the Organizational Structures section with its description and status visible.

We repeat this process for the Technology Risk Committee, documenting its purpose as chair (CRO), bi-weekly frequency, and reporting relationship to the Board Audit Committee. We document the Architecture Review Board, Change Advisory Board, Portfolio Management Office, Cloud Center of Excellence (marking it "In Progress"), Data Governance Council (marking it "Planned"), Security Operations Center, IT Service Desk, and Enterprise Architecture Team. As we add each component, the platform builds a comprehensive organizational structure catalog. We can see that we have 7 completed structures, 2 in progress, and 1 planned, giving us visibility into implementation status.

Now we move to Processes and Practices. We select "Processes & Practices" from the component type dropdown and begin adding process components. We click "Add Component" and document our first process: Strategic Planning Process. In the Description, we write: "Annual IT strategic planning aligned with business strategy. Process includes environmental scanning, goal setting, initiative identification, resource planning, and approval by IT Steering Committee. Strategy reviewed and updated quarterly." We set Status to "Completed" and save to move to the next process.

We document the Portfolio Management Process, noting it covers portfolio intake, prioritization, and optimization using ServiceNow PPM. We document the Enterprise Risk Management Process following the three lines of defense model. We continue documenting Incident Management, Change Management, Configuration Management (marking "In Progress"), Vendor Management, Business Continuity Planning, Security Incident Response, Performance Monitoring (marking "In Progress"), Compliance Management, and Benefits Realization (marking "In Progress"). With 12 processes documented, we see that 8 are completed, 3 in progress, and 1 planned, showing good process maturity with some gaps being actively addressed.

We move to Information Flows and Items. We select this component type and document the Governance Dashboard, specifying that it's an executive dashboard with governance metrics for the Board and IT Steering Committee, refreshed monthly, produced from ServiceNow GRC and PowerBI. We set Status to "Completed." We document Risk Register and Heat Maps, Portfolio Performance Reports, Service Performance Reports, Compliance Attestation Reports, Architecture Repository (marking "In Progress"), Security Posture Reports, and Knowledge Base and Documentation (marking "In Progress"). Each information component specifies its content, audience, frequency, and producing system. With 8 information components documented, we see 5 completed and 3 in progress.

For Culture Ethics and Behavior, we document 6 cultural components. We add the IT Code of Conduct, marking it "Completed" with description of ethical standards and annual mandatory training. We document the Cybersecurity Awareness Program as "Completed" with monthly phishing simulations and quarterly training. We document Innovation Culture Program marking it "In Progress" with initiatives including hackathons and innovation time. We document Customer-Centric Service Culture marking "In Progress," Continuous Improvement Mindset marking "In Progress," and Transparency and Accountability marking "Completed." We see that 2 are completed and 4 in progress, reflecting that cultural transformation takes longer than implementing technical components.

We move to Skills and Competencies. We document the IT Competency Framework marking "In Progress" with 45 IT job families defined. We document the Technical Skills Training Program marking "Completed" with $2M annual budget and platforms like Pluralsight and cloud vendor certifications. We document Leadership Development Program marking "Completed" with 50 participants. We document Agile and DevOps Coaching marking "Completed" with 5 agile coaches. We document Architecture and Design Skills marking "In Progress" with a target of 20 certified cloud architects. We document Vendor and Sourcing Management Skills marking "Planned" with a target to train 15 vendor managers by Q1 2025. With 6 skill components documented, we see 3 completed, 2 in progress, and 1 planned.

Finally, we document Services Infrastructure and Applications. We add the GRC Platform (ServiceNow GRC module) marking "Completed," noting it provides risk management, compliance, and policy management capabilities. We document the ITSM Platform (ServiceNow ITSM) marking "Completed" supporting service management processes. We document PPM Tools marking "Completed." We document the Enterprise Architecture Management Tool (LeanIX) marking "In Progress" with target completion Q4 2024. We document SIEM (Splunk Enterprise Security) marking "Completed" with 100% critical systems coverage. We document Cloud Management Platform (CloudHealth) marking "In Progress" with full deployment targeted for Q3 2024. With 6 technology components documented, we see 3 completed and 3 in progress.

With all six categories populated, the platform generates comprehensive analytics. We see summary statistics: 48 total components defined, 28 completed (58%), 16 in progress (33%), 4 planned (8%). We see a breakdown by category showing how many components are in each category and their status distribution. This visibility helps program managers understand what's operational, what's being built, and what's planned for the future.

The platform provides filtering capabilities. We can filter to show only "In Progress" components—the list narrows to 16 components that require active attention and resources. This filtered view helps program managers track implementation progress and allocate resources effectively.

We present the component catalog to the IT Steering Committee. There's discussion about whether 16 components in progress is manageable given resource constraints. The CIO presents resource allocations showing sufficient budget and staffing for the in-progress components. There's also discussion about the 4 planned components and when they'll move to in progress status. The CIO commits to providing quarterly component status updates.

One committee member asks how we'll maintain this component catalog over time. The CIO explains that the Governance Office will conduct quarterly reviews to ensure the catalog remains accurate and reflects current implementation status. The committee approves the component definition as a living document that will evolve as governance matures. With all 48 components documented, TechCorp has completed Phase 2 of their COBIT implementation. They've defined what they want to achieve—governance context, capability gaps, governance and management objectives—and they've defined how they'll achieve it—organizational structures, processes, information, culture, skills, and technologies. This comprehensive foundation positions TechCorp to move into Phase 3: Implementation and Operationalization, where these defined components will be built, deployed, and put into active operation.
