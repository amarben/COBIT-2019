# STEP 7: PRIORITY IMPLEMENTATION

## Slide 1: Step Overview

### Slide Title: Priority Implementation - Executing the Governance Roadmap

### Slide Notes:

Step 7 marks the transition from planning to execution. After defining governance context, assessing capabilities, designing the governance system, selecting objectives, and defining components, we now implement these elements in a structured, prioritized manner. Priority Implementation is where governance moves from documents and designs into operational reality. This step is critical because it determines whether the carefully designed governance framework becomes an effective operating system or remains aspirational paperwork. The key challenge is that most organizations cannot implement everything simultaneously—they must prioritize what to implement first, sequence implementation waves, and ensure early implementations build a stable foundation for subsequent work.

Priority Implementation follows a wave-based approach where objectives and components are implemented in logical groupings over time. Wave 1 typically focuses on foundational elements—establishing core governance structures like steering committees, implementing fundamental processes like risk management, and deploying essential enabling technologies like GRC platforms. Without these foundations, subsequent implementations lack the scaffolding they need to succeed. Wave 2 usually focuses on value delivery and performance management—implementing portfolio management, benefits realization, performance measurement, and reporting capabilities. These build on the governance foundation to demonstrate value and maintain stakeholder support. Wave 3 often focuses on operational excellence—maturing service delivery, change management, configuration management, and operational processes. Wave 4 and beyond address strategic capabilities like innovation management, advanced analytics, and optimization initiatives.

The sequencing of implementation waves should be guided by several factors. First, capability gaps and priorities identified in Step 2 assessment—objectives with the largest gaps and highest business impact should be prioritized. Second, dependencies between objectives and components—some objectives require others to be in place first. For example, performance measurement depends on having defined processes to measure. Third, stakeholder needs and regulatory requirements—compliance obligations often cannot be deferred and must be addressed early. Fourth, resource availability and organizational capacity for change—implementing too much too fast overwhelms the organization and risks failure. Fifth, quick wins and momentum building—some early implementations should deliver visible value quickly to build credibility and stakeholder support for continued investment.

Each implementation wave requires careful planning including scope definition, resource allocation, timeline, success criteria, and risk management. Implementation is not just about creating new processes or deploying new tools—it requires change management to help people adopt new ways of working, communication to ensure stakeholders understand what's changing and why, training to build necessary skills, and measurement to track progress and identify issues early. The implementation approach should be iterative rather than big-bang—pilot implementations with small groups before enterprise rollout, gather feedback and refine, then scale. This reduces risk and ensures implementations are practical and sustainable. Priority Implementation is not a one-time activity but a multi-year journey, and maintaining momentum through executive sponsorship, regular progress reporting, and celebration of milestones is essential for long-term success.

### Bullet Points:

- **Wave-Based Implementation**: Implement objectives and components in prioritized waves rather than attempting everything simultaneously
- **Foundation First**: Wave 1 focuses on core governance structures, fundamental processes, and essential enabling technologies
- **Dependency Management**: Sequence implementations based on dependencies—some objectives require others to be operational first
- **Resource Realism**: Match implementation ambition to available resources and organizational capacity for change to ensure sustainability
- **Quick Wins Strategy**: Include early implementations that deliver visible value quickly to build momentum and stakeholder confidence
- **Change Management**: Implementation requires more than technical work—includes communication, training, adoption support, and culture change
- **Pilot and Scale**: Use iterative approach with pilots, feedback, refinement, then enterprise rollout to reduce risk and ensure practicality
- **Multi-Year Journey**: Recognize governance maturation is measured in years not months, maintaining executive sponsorship and momentum throughout

### Slide Title: TechCorp Financial Services - Phased Implementation Roadmap

### Slide Notes:

TechCorp Financial Services developed a four-wave implementation roadmap spanning 18 months from Q2 2024 through Q2 2025. This phased approach was designed to build a stable governance foundation, demonstrate value through portfolio and performance management, achieve operational excellence, and finally develop strategic capabilities. The roadmap was presented to and approved by the IT Steering Committee with quarterly progress reviews to ensure accountability and enable course corrections. Let's examine each implementation wave and what TechCorp achieved.

Wave 1, Foundation, ran from Q2 to Q3 2024 and is now completed. This wave focused on establishing core governance structures and frameworks. For EDM01 (Governance Framework), TechCorp achieved governance charter approval by the Board, made the IT Steering Committee operational with monthly meetings and clear decision rights, launched a governance dashboard providing monthly metrics to leadership, and established an annual governance review cycle. For APO01 (IT Management Framework), they defined an integrated management approach adopting COBIT as the official framework, initiated process documentation across all domains, and established the Governance Office to support implementation. For APO12 (Managed Risk), they achieved IT risk appetite statement approval by the Board, established a risk register with 45 active IT risks, implemented monthly risk reporting to the Technology Risk Committee, and integrated IT risks into the enterprise risk management system. For APO13 (Managed Security), they approved the information security policy framework comprising 15 security policies, defined security architecture and standards including zero trust principles, and approved a multi-year zero trust implementation roadmap. This foundational wave established the governance scaffolding upon which all subsequent work would build.

Wave 2, Value and Performance, ran from Q3 to Q4 2024 and is currently in progress at 70% completion. This wave focuses on demonstrating IT value and establishing performance management. For EDM02 (Benefits Delivery), TechCorp designed a benefits realization framework including standardized business case templates and benefits tracking methodology, began implementing a portfolio value tracking tool integrated with ServiceNow PPM, and is training 25 portfolio managers on benefits management practices. For APO05 (Managed Portfolio), they made the portfolio management process fully operational with monthly portfolio reviews, are refining the portfolio optimization model to better balance strategic value against risk and resource constraints, and established a strategic portfolio review cadence where the IT Steering Committee reviews the entire portfolio quarterly. For APO06 (Managed Budget and Costs), they aligned the IT budget process with strategic planning ensuring investments are tied to strategic objectives, launched cloud FinOps implementation to optimize cloud spending, and are developing cost allocation and chargeback models to improve transparency and accountability. For MEA01 (Performance and Conformance Monitoring), they defined a comprehensive KPI framework with 30 metrics across governance and management domains, are developing performance dashboards in PowerBI, and have planned the conformance monitoring approach for Q4. This wave is on track to complete by year-end.

Wave 3, Operational Excellence, is planned for Q4 2024 through Q1 2025. This wave focuses on maturing operational service delivery and process execution. For DSS01 (Managed Operations), planned activities include developing comprehensive operational runbooks and procedures, enhancing SLA management with proactive monitoring and escalation, and implementing operational metrics and reporting dashboards. For DSS02 (Service Requests and Incidents), plans include enhancing the service catalog with self-service capabilities, implementing service portal improvements to improve user experience, and deploying AI-powered incident resolution to reduce resolution times. For BAI06 (Managed IT Changes), planned activities include implementing automated change workflows to increase efficiency, making post-implementation reviews mandatory for all normal and high-risk changes, and improving change risk assessment through better integration with CMDB and architecture repository. For BAI10 (Managed Configuration), TechCorp plans to improve CMDB accuracy from the current 87% to 95%, implement automated discovery and reconciliation to maintain accuracy, and enhance integration between CMDB and change management to improve impact analysis. These operational improvements will directly impact service quality and customer satisfaction.

Wave 4, Strategic Capabilities, is planned for Q1 to Q2 2025 and focuses on developing advanced governance and management capabilities. For APO02 (Managed Strategy), planned activities include enhancing the strategic planning process with more rigorous environmental scanning and scenario planning, implementing strategy execution tracking to monitor how well strategic initiatives are progressing, and establishing strategic initiative portfolio management as a distinct capability from operational project portfolio management. For APO03 (Managed Enterprise Architecture), plans include completing the enterprise architecture repository in LeanIX, maturing the Architecture Review Board with clear standards and fast review cycles, and implementing technical debt management with quantified metrics and reduction targets. For APO07 (Managed Human Resources), planned activities include rolling out the IT competency framework across all 45 job families, developing talent pipeline programs for critical roles, and launching diversity and inclusion initiatives to improve workforce composition and culture. This wave positions TechCorp for long-term governance sustainability and continuous improvement.

As of September 2024, TechCorp's implementation metrics show strong progress. Of 127 total practices defined across the 37 enabled objectives, 68 practices are fully implemented representing 54% completion, 35 practices are in progress representing 28%, and 24 practices are planned representing 19%. This distribution shows a healthy implementation pipeline with more than half of work completed and the remainder actively progressing. The phased approach has proven effective—Wave 1 completed on schedule, Wave 2 is on track for year-end completion, and Waves 3 and 4 have detailed plans with assigned resources. Quarterly implementation reviews with the IT Steering Committee provide governance oversight, ensure accountability, and enable adjustments when issues arise. The wave-based approach has allowed TechCorp to build governance systematically, maintain quality, avoid overwhelming the organization, and demonstrate continuous progress to stakeholders.

## Slide 3: Video Demo Narrative

### Video Title: Tracking Priority Implementation in the COBIT 2019 Platform

### Video Notes:

Welcome to our demonstration of Step 7: Priority Implementation in the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. This is where we visualize our governance implementation roadmap based on the objectives we selected in Steps 4 and 5. Let's navigate to Step 7: Priority Implementation from the main dashboard. The platform displays a simple, auto-generated implementation roadmap organized into three phases based on our selections.

The platform shows us summary statistics at the top: the number of governance objectives enabled (from Step 4), the number of management objectives enabled (from Step 5), and the count of high-priority objectives that will drive our initial implementation focus. These metrics give us an immediate snapshot of our implementation scope.

Below the summary, we see our implementation roadmap visualized as three sequential phases. Phase 1 is labeled "Governance Foundation" and includes all the EDM governance objectives we enabled in Step 4. This makes sense conceptually—establishing the governance foundation through the Board and executive oversight is the first priority. The platform shows which specific objectives are included in this phase, such as EDM01 (Governance Framework), EDM02 (Benefits Delivery), EDM03 (Risk Optimization), EDM04 (Resource Optimization), and EDM05 (Stakeholder Engagement). This phase establishes the governance scaffolding that will oversee all subsequent implementation work.

Phase 2 is labeled "High Priority Management" and includes the management objectives we marked as high priority in Step 5. The platform automatically groups these together because high-priority objectives represent the most critical capabilities that need attention. For TechCorp, this phase includes objectives like APO05 (Portfolio Management), APO12 (Risk Management), APO13 (Security), DSS02 (Service Requests and Incidents), DSS05 (Security Services), and MEA03 (Compliance). These are the management execution capabilities that directly support the governance objectives from Phase 1 and address TechCorp's most critical capability gaps.

Phase 3 is labeled "Additional Objectives" and includes the management objectives we marked as medium or low priority in Step 5. This phase represents important but less urgent capabilities that can be implemented once the foundation and high-priority capabilities are in place. The platform groups these together automatically, creating a natural sequencing of implementation from most critical to important-but-can-wait.

This simple three-phase roadmap provides valuable conceptual guidance for TechCorp's implementation journey. While it doesn't include detailed timelines, milestones, or practice-level tracking, it gives executives and stakeholders a clear view of the implementation sequence: first establish governance oversight, then build critical management capabilities, then expand to additional capabilities. This phasing makes intuitive sense and helps communicate the multi-year implementation journey in a way that's easy to understand.

The platform helps validate our implementation approach. If we had forgotten to enable any governance objectives in Step 4, Phase 1 would show a warning that governance foundation is incomplete. If we marked too many objectives as high priority in Step 5, Phase 2 might be overwhelming, signaling that we need to be more selective about priorities. The automatic roadmap generation based on our selections provides a sanity check that our configuration makes sense.

For TechCorp, the three-phase roadmap confirms the implementation approach makes sense: 5 governance objectives in Phase 1 establishing oversight, 22 high-priority management objectives in Phase 2 building critical capabilities, and 10 medium-priority objectives in Phase 3 for future expansion. This phasing reflects TechCorp's strategic priorities and resource capacity.

While detailed implementation planning—defining specific timelines, milestones, resource allocations, dependencies, and risks—happens outside the platform through project management tools and governance committee discussions, this conceptual roadmap provides a valuable starting point. It helps TechCorp communicate the implementation journey to stakeholders, align on priorities, and maintain focus on the sequencing of foundation first, then high priorities, then expansion. The roadmap serves as a guide for the detailed implementation work documented in Slide 2, where we saw TechCorp's four-wave detailed plan with specific timelines, practice-level tracking, and progress monitoring.

# STEP 8: PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT

## Slide 1: Step Overview

### Slide Title: Establishing Performance Measurement - Making Governance Visible

### Slide Notes:

Step 8, Performance Measurement, is where we make governance tangible and accountable by defining the metrics that demonstrate whether governance is effective and whether objectives are being achieved. In governance and management, what gets measured gets managed, and what gets reported gets attention. Without performance measurement, governance remains abstract and its value is questioned. With robust performance measurement, governance becomes evidence-based, stakeholders can see progress objectively, and governance bodies can make informed decisions about where to invest, where to improve, and where to celebrate success. Performance measurement transforms governance from a compliance activity into a value-driving management discipline.

COBIT provides a comprehensive measurement framework with multiple metric types. Goals are high-level outcome metrics that indicate whether strategic objectives are being achieved. These might include governance effectiveness scores, stakeholder satisfaction ratings, or portfolio value delivered. Key Performance Indicators, or KPIs, are process-level metrics that measure how well processes are performing against defined targets. These might include incident resolution times, change success rates, project on-time delivery percentages, or security control effectiveness. Process Capability Indicators measure the maturity level of processes against the COBIT capability model. These might include assessments of whether processes are at Level 2 Managed, Level 3 Established, or Level 4 Predictable. Maturity Indicators assess the overall maturity of governance and management across domains or the entire framework.

Effective performance measurement requires several elements. First, each metric must have a clear definition including what is measured, how it is calculated, and what the units are. Ambiguous metrics lead to inconsistent measurement and meaningless data. Second, each metric must have a defined target representing the desired performance level. Targets should be realistic but ambitious, grounded in capability assessment baselines, and aligned with enterprise goals. Third, metrics must be traceable to specific objectives they support, ensuring measurement is purpose-driven rather than measuring for measurement's sake. Organizations should focus on the fundamental metric attributes: name, type (goal, KPI, process capability, or maturity indicator), related objective, target value, current value, and unit of measurement.

Organizations should avoid common measurement pitfalls. First, measuring too much—organizations sometimes define hundreds of metrics that overwhelm stakeholders and consume excessive effort to collect and report. A focused set of 20-30 key metrics is more effective than 200 metrics that nobody reviews. Second, measuring the wrong things—metrics should focus on outcomes and impact, not just activities and outputs. Measuring how many meetings governance committees held is less valuable than measuring whether governance decisions improved IT-business alignment. Third, setting unrealistic targets that demotivate teams when they consistently miss them. Fourth, failing to act on metrics—if metrics consistently show poor performance but no corrective action is taken, measurement becomes pointless theater. Fifth, gaming metrics—when people are measured on something, they optimize for that metric even if it harms overall performance. Effective measurement requires balanced scorecards, leading and lagging indicators, and a culture of learning rather than blame. Performance measurement is not about punishment but about visibility, learning, and continuous improvement.

### Bullet Points:

- **Multi-Level Metrics**: Define goals, KPIs, process capability indicators, and maturity indicators to measure governance effectiveness comprehensively
- **Outcome Focus**: Emphasize outcome and impact metrics over activity and output metrics to ensure measurement drives value
- **Clear Definitions**: Each metric requires precise definition including calculation method, units, and interpretation guidance
- **Realistic Targets**: Set targets grounded in baseline capability, aligned with enterprise goals, ambitious but achievable to motivate improvement
- **Objective Traceability**: Link each metric to specific governance or management objectives it measures, ensuring purpose-driven measurement
- **Streamlined Attributes**: Focus on essential metric elements—name, type, objective, target, current value, unit—with progress visualization
- **Balanced Scorecards**: Use balanced sets of metrics covering financial, stakeholder, process, and learning perspectives to avoid gaming and narrow optimization
- **Action-Oriented**: Ensure metrics inform decisions and drive improvement rather than being collected for compliance theater

### Slide Title: TechCorp Financial Services - Comprehensive Performance Framework

### Slide Notes:

TechCorp Financial Services established a comprehensive performance measurement framework with 30 key metrics spanning all governance and management domains. This framework was designed to provide balanced visibility into governance effectiveness, value delivery, risk management, operational performance, and compliance. The metrics were approved by the IT Steering Committee and are reported through multiple dashboards and reports tailored to different stakeholder audiences. Let's examine key metrics across the domains and how TechCorp uses them to drive governance effectiveness.

For the EDM governance domain, TechCorp defined five critical metrics. The Governance Effectiveness Score is a Goal-type metric with a target of 4.0 out of 5.0, currently at 3.2, measured annually through comprehensive stakeholder surveys. This metric directly measures EDM01 and provides overall governance health visibility. Benefits Realization Rate is a KPI measuring EDM02, with a target of 85% of planned benefits achieved within 12 months of project completion, currently at 62%. This metric is measured by the Portfolio Management Office comparing actual benefits realized to benefits promised in business cases. IT Risk Incidents (Material) is a KPI for EDM03, with a target of no more than 2 material incidents per year requiring Board notification, currently at 5 year-to-date. This metric highlights that risk management needs improvement despite being relatively mature. IT Budget Variance is a KPI for EDM04, targeting plus or minus 5% variance, currently at plus 8%, indicating resource optimization needs attention. Stakeholder Satisfaction Score is a Goal for EDM05, targeting 4.2 out of 5.0, currently at 3.8, measured quarterly through targeted stakeholder surveys. These five governance metrics provide executives and the Board with clear visibility into whether governance is working.

For the APO strategic alignment domain, TechCorp defined eight key metrics. Strategic Initiative On-Time Delivery measures APO02, targeting 90% of strategic programs delivered on schedule, currently at 78%. This metric identifies project delivery capability gaps. Architecture Compliance Rate measures APO03, targeting 95% of projects compliant with architecture standards, currently at 82%. This metric drives architecture discipline and technical debt management. Innovation Investment measures APO04, targeting 15% of IT budget allocated to innovation, currently at 11%. This metric ensures innovation doesn't get crowded out by operational demands. Portfolio Value Score measures APO05, targeting a weighted portfolio value assessment of 4.0, currently at 3.5. IT Cost Optimization measures APO06, targeting 10% year-over-year cost reduction through efficiency gains, currently at 6%. IT Employee Turnover Rate measures APO07, targeting no more than 10% annual voluntary turnover, currently at 14%, indicating talent retention challenges. Critical Vendor SLA Compliance measures APO10, targeting 98% of vendor SLAs met, currently at 94%. Security Control Effectiveness measures APO13, targeting 95% of security controls operating effectively, currently at 89%. These metrics provide comprehensive visibility into strategic alignment and foundational capability health.

For the BAI build and implement domain, TechCorp defined six metrics. Requirements Defect Rate measures BAI02, targeting no more than 5% of defects attributable to requirements issues, currently at 8%. Solution Delivery Cycle Time measures BAI03, targeting 45 days average from requirements to production, currently at 62 days. Infrastructure Availability measures BAI04, targeting 99.95% uptime for critical infrastructure, currently at 99.87%, just short of target. Change Success Rate measures BAI06, targeting 95% of changes implemented without incidents or rollbacks, currently at 92%. CMDB Accuracy measures BAI10, targeting 95% configuration item accuracy, currently at 87%, a known gap being addressed in Wave 3. Project On-Time Delivery measures BAI11, targeting 85% of projects delivered on schedule, currently at 73%, indicating project management needs improvement. These metrics highlight delivery capability strengths and weaknesses, informing capability building investments.

For the DSS operational domain, TechCorp defined six metrics. Incident Resolution Time (P1) measures DSS02, targeting resolution within 4 hours, currently averaging 5.2 hours. First Contact Resolution Rate measures DSS02, targeting 75% of incidents resolved at first contact, currently at 68%. Problem Resolution Effectiveness measures DSS03, targeting 90% of problems with root cause identified and permanent fix implemented, currently at 78%. Business Continuity Test Success measures DSS04, targeting 100% of DR test objectives achieved, currently at 95%. Security Incident Mean Time to Detect measures DSS05, targeting detection within 2 hours, currently at 3.5 hours. Security Incident Mean Time to Respond measures DSS05, targeting containment within 4 hours, currently at 6 hours. These operational metrics provide daily management insight into service quality and areas requiring operational improvement.

For the MEA monitoring and compliance domain, TechCorp defined five metrics. Compliance Attestation Coverage measures MEA03, targeting 100% of required controls with documented evidence, currently at 98%. Regulatory Audit Findings (Material) measures MEA03, targeting zero material findings, currently at 2 year-to-date from GDPR and SOX audits. Internal Audit Finding Remediation measures MEA04, targeting 100% of findings remediated within 90 days, currently at 85%. Control Testing Coverage measures MEA02, targeting 100% of key controls tested annually, currently at 92%. These compliance metrics ensure TechCorp maintains regulatory standing and control effectiveness.

These 30 metrics are reported through multiple mechanisms. The Board receives a quarterly Governance Scorecard showing the 5 EDM metrics plus 5 high-level KPIs summarizing portfolio, risk, compliance, and operational performance. The IT Steering Committee receives a monthly IT Balanced Scorecard showing 20 metrics across stakeholder, financial, process, and learning perspectives, organized using Balanced Scorecard methodology. The Technology Risk Committee receives a bi-weekly Risk Dashboard showing risk and security metrics. Operational managers receive weekly Operational Dashboards showing service delivery and incident metrics. All dashboards are produced from integrated data sources—ServiceNow GRC for governance and compliance metrics, ServiceNow ITSM for operational metrics, PowerBI for portfolio and financial metrics, Splunk for security metrics. This integrated measurement approach ensures consistent data, reduces manual reporting effort, and provides stakeholders with timely, accurate performance visibility.

## Slide 3: Video Demo Narrative

### Video Title: Configuring Performance Metrics in the COBIT 2019 Platform

### Video Notes:

**Reference Implementation: TechCorp Financial Services**

Welcome to our demonstration of Step 8: Performance Measurement in the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. In this reference implementation, we review how TechCorp Financial Services defined the metrics that make governance visible and accountable, providing stakeholders with clear visibility into governance effectiveness and performance. Let's navigate to Step 8: Performance Measurement from the main dashboard. The platform displays a metrics management interface organized by domain, showing EDM, APO, BAI, DSS, and MEA sections where we can define metrics for each enabled objective.

We start by reviewing metrics for the EDM governance domain. We click on the EDM section and see TechCorp's five enabled governance objectives: EDM01 through EDM05. We click "Add Metric" for EDM01 (Governance Framework) and a streamlined metric definition form opens. We see fields for Metric Name, Metric Type (with dropdown options: Goal, KPI, Process Capability, Maturity), Target Value, Current Value, Unit of Measure, and Related Objective. Let's examine TechCorp's first metric: Governance Effectiveness Score.

The metric shows Name: "Governance Effectiveness Score". For Metric Type, it's set to "Goal" because this is a high-level outcome metric. Target Value is "4.0" and Current Value is "3.2". Unit of Measure is "Score (1-5 scale)". Related Objective is EDM01. The platform displays a progress bar visualization showing 3.2/4.0 (80% of target). This streamlined approach focuses on the essential metric attributes without administrative overhead like measurement frequency, owner assignments, or data source documentation. The metric definition is clear and actionable.

We continue reviewing the remaining EDM metrics. TechCorp defined Benefits Realization Rate for EDM02, KPI type, target 85%, current 62%, unit percentage, with a progress bar showing 62/85 (73% of target). IT Risk Incidents (Material) for EDM03, KPI type, target 2 per year, current 5 year-to-date, unit incidents. IT Budget Variance for EDM04, KPI type, target plus or minus 5%, current plus 8%, unit percentage variance. Stakeholder Satisfaction Score for EDM05, Goal type, target 4.2, current 3.8, unit score (1-5 scale). With all five EDM metrics defined, the platform displays them in a summary view showing metric names, types, targets, current values, progress bars, and status indicators (green for meeting target, yellow for close, red for below target).

Now we move to the APO domain. We expand the APO section and see TechCorp's 13 enabled objectives. We review metrics for each high-priority objective. For APO02 (Strategy), Strategic Initiative On-Time Delivery is a KPI, target 90%, current 78%. For APO03 (Architecture), Architecture Compliance Rate is a Process Capability indicator, target 95%, current 82%.

For APO04 (Innovation), Innovation Investment is a Goal metric, target 15% of IT budget, current 11%. For APO05 (Portfolio), Portfolio Value Score is a KPI, target 4.0, current 3.5. For APO06 (Budget and Costs), IT Cost Optimization is a Goal, target 10% year-over-year reduction, current 6% achieved. For APO07 (Human Resources), IT Employee Turnover Rate is a KPI, target no more than 10%, current 14%.

We continue through APO, BAI, DSS, and MEA domains, reviewing TechCorp's 30 total metrics. The platform makes it easy to copy and modify metrics—when reviewing Incident Resolution Time for Priority 1 incidents, we can see how this pattern could be duplicated for Priority 2, 3, and 4 incidents with different targets, creating a complete incident resolution metric set efficiently. As we examine each metric, the platform shows that required fields are completed and that relationships to objectives are specified. This ensures metrics are well-defined and traceable to what they measure.

With all 30 metrics defined, we navigate to the Metrics Dashboard view. The platform displays comprehensive analytics and visualizations without domain grouping—all metrics are visible in a unified view organized by status (green, yellow, red) rather than by domain. We see a performance breakdown showing what percentage are meeting targets. Overall status shows 0% meeting targets, 43% close, and 57% below target—highlighting that focused improvement is needed. The unified view helps leadership understand overall governance health and where to focus improvement efforts across all objectives simultaneously.

We see a metric status summary showing 3 metrics meeting targets (10%), 13 close to targets (43%), and 14 below targets (47%). This overall performance status is concerning but expected—we're early in our governance journey and metrics provide baseline visibility. What matters is not current performance but that we now have clear visibility and can track improvement over time. The platform provides trending capabilities—we can view how metrics change quarter over quarter, showing whether we're improving, stable, or declining. For example, Security Control Effectiveness has improved from 83% in Q1 to 89% in Q3, showing positive trend toward the 95% target.

The platform also provides correlation analysis. We can see that Benefits Realization Rate (currently 62%) correlates with Project On-Time Delivery (currently 73%)—when projects deliver late, benefits are also delayed, suggesting that improving project delivery will improve benefits realization. This type of insight helps prioritize improvement initiatives. We can also see leading and lagging indicator relationships—IT Employee Turnover Rate (leading indicator) correlates with Project On-Time Delivery (lagging indicator) because turnover disrupts project teams, suggesting that addressing turnover will improve delivery performance.

The platform provides powerful filtering and reporting capabilities. We filter to show only "Below Target" metrics—the list narrows to 14 metrics requiring attention. We export this as a Red Metrics Report that will be discussed in the next IT Steering Committee meeting to prioritize improvement initiatives. We can filter by metric type, related objective, or status to create different analytical views helping teams understand performance patterns and priorities.

We create custom dashboards for different stakeholder audiences. We create a Board Governance Scorecard selecting the 5 EDM metrics plus 5 high-level KPIs: Benefits Realization Rate, IT Risk Incidents, Stakeholder Satisfaction, Infrastructure Availability, and Compliance Attestation Coverage. This 10-metric scorecard provides Board-level visibility without overwhelming them with operational detail. We save this as a custom dashboard that will be included in quarterly Board governance reports. We create an IT Balanced Scorecard organizing 20 metrics into four perspectives: Stakeholder Perspective (stakeholder satisfaction, benefits realization, strategic alignment), Financial Perspective (budget variance, cost optimization, portfolio ROI), Internal Process Perspective (change success, incident resolution, project delivery), and Learning and Growth Perspective (employee satisfaction, training completion, turnover). This balanced view prevents narrow optimization and ensures we're improving across all dimensions.

We export a Performance Measurement Framework document that details all 30 metrics with complete definitions, targets, and objective traceability. This document is reviewed by the IT Steering Committee. During the review, there's discussion about whether 30 metrics is too many or too few. The CIO explains that 30 represents a focused set—there could be 200 metrics if we measured everything, but these 30 are the critical few that leadership needs to monitor. The committee also discusses targets—some members feel targets are too ambitious given current performance. The CIO explains that targets represent where we need to be to meet enterprise goals and stakeholder expectations, not just incremental improvement from current state. The committee approves the framework with the understanding that targets may be refined after six months of measurement to ensure they're realistic but ambitious.

The IT Steering Committee also establishes a rhythm of metric review. Metrics will be reviewed with appropriate frequency based on their nature and volatility, ensuring metrics receive appropriate attention without overwhelming leadership. The committee also establishes that for any metric below target for three consecutive measurement periods, a formal improvement initiative must be proposed and resourced. This "three strikes" rule ensures metrics drive action rather than becoming ignored background noise.

With the performance measurement framework defined, approved, and operational, TechCorp has made governance visible and accountable. Stakeholders can now see objectively whether governance is effective, where performance is strong, where it needs improvement, and whether improvement initiatives are working. This transparency builds confidence in governance as a value-driving discipline rather than overhead, and provides the data foundation for continuous improvement in Step 13.

# STEP 9: ENABLER DEPLOYMENT

## Slide 1: Step Overview

### Slide Title: Deploying Enablers - Empowering Governance Execution

### Slide Notes:

Step 9, Enabler Deployment, focuses on implementing the supporting elements that enable people to execute governance and management objectives effectively. While Steps 4-6 defined what we want to achieve (objectives) and how we'll organize to achieve it (components), Step 9 focuses on providing the tools, policies, skills, technologies, and cultural elements that empower people to actually do governance work. Enablers are the difference between governance that exists on paper and governance that operates in practice. Without proper enablers, even well-designed governance frameworks fail because people lack the policies guiding their decisions, the tools supporting their work, the skills performing their responsibilities, or the cultural norms encouraging right behaviors.

COBIT identifies enablers across multiple categories matching the component structure from Step 6. Policy and procedure enablers provide the rules, standards, and guidelines that govern decision-making and behavior. These include governance policies approved by the Board, standard operating procedures for operational processes, work instructions for specific tasks, and reference materials supporting execution. Without clear policies, people make inconsistent decisions, creating governance unpredictability. Tool and technology enablers provide the platforms, applications, and automation supporting governance activities. These include GRC platforms for risk and compliance management, ITSM platforms for service delivery, portfolio management tools, monitoring and analytics platforms, and collaboration tools. Without appropriate tooling, governance processes are manual, error-prone, and unsustainable.

Skills and competency enablers ensure people have the knowledge and capabilities to perform governance responsibilities. These include training programs building technical and governance skills, certification programs validating competency, coaching and mentoring supporting skill application, and competency frameworks defining required skill levels for different roles. Without adequate skills, people struggle to execute even well-documented processes. Culture and behavior enablers shape the values, norms, and expectations that influence how people act. These include awareness programs educating people on governance importance, leadership behaviors modeling desired actions, recognition and reward systems reinforcing right behaviors, and cultural transformation initiatives shifting mindsets. Without supportive culture, people see governance as bureaucracy to circumvent rather than value to embrace.

Enabler deployment should be strategic and sequenced. Organizations should prioritize enablers that remove critical barriers to governance execution. If lack of training is preventing people from using a new GRC platform, training should be prioritized. If lack of clear policies is causing inconsistent risk decisions, policy development should be prioritized. If cultural resistance is preventing adoption of new portfolio management processes, change management and awareness should be prioritized. Enabler deployment is not a one-time activity but continuous—as governance matures, enabler needs evolve. Initial enablers might focus on basic training and essential tools, while later enablers might focus on advanced skills and optimization technologies. Organizations should measure enabler effectiveness, not just deployment completion. Deploying a tool is not success—people using the tool effectively is success. Publishing a policy is not success—people following the policy is success. Providing training is not success—people applying learned skills is success. Enabler deployment requires adoption focus, change management, and measurement of utilization and effectiveness.

### Bullet Points:

- **Multi-Category Enablers**: Deploy policies, tools, skills, and cultural elements that empower people to execute governance effectively
- **Policy and Procedure Enablers**: Provide clear rules, standards, guidelines, and work instructions that govern decisions and behaviors
- **Tool and Technology Enablers**: Deploy GRC platforms, ITSM tools, portfolio management systems, analytics, and automation supporting governance execution
- **Skills and Competency Enablers**: Ensure people have necessary knowledge through training, certification, coaching, and competency frameworks
- **Culture and Behavior Enablers**: Shape values, norms, and expectations through awareness programs, leadership modeling, and recognition systems
- **Barrier Removal Focus**: Prioritize enablers that remove critical obstacles preventing governance execution and effectiveness
- **Adoption Over Deployment**: Measure effectiveness through usage and impact, not just deployment completion—tools deployed but unused are wasted investment
- **Continuous Evolution**: Recognize enabler needs change as governance matures—initial enablers differ from optimization-stage enablers

## Slide 2: Application by the Model Company

### Slide Title: TechCorp Financial Services - Comprehensive Enabler Deployment

### Slide Notes:

TechCorp Financial Services deployed 26 enablers across four categories: policies and procedures, tools and technologies, skills development, and culture and behavior. This enabler deployment was integrated with the implementation waves from Step 7—foundational enablers were deployed in Wave 1, value and performance enablers in Wave 2, operational enablers in Wave 3, and strategic enablers in Wave 4. Enabler deployment status as of September 2024 shows strong progress with 85% of policy enablers completed, 70% of tool enablers completed, 60% of skills enablers completed, and 50% of culture enablers completed. The varying completion rates reflect that policy and tool deployment is faster than building skills and changing culture. Let's examine key enablers across each category.

For Policies and Procedures, TechCorp deployed eight key enablers. The IT Governance Policy is completed at version 2.1, approved in March 2024, defining governance framework, roles, and decision rights. This policy provides the constitutional foundation for all governance activities. The Enterprise Risk Management Policy is completed at version 3.0, approved in January 2024, covering risk appetite, assessment methodology, and treatment requirements. The Information Security Policy Framework is completed comprising 15 security policies covering all domains including access control, encryption, incident response, and vendor security, all on an annual review cycle. Change Management Standard Operating Procedures are completed with 8 SOPs covering standard, normal, emergency, and post-implementation review processes, along with CAB charter and escalation procedures.

Incident Management Playbooks are completed with 15 playbooks covering major incident types including security breaches, system outages, data loss, and service degradations, with quarterly updates based on lessons learned. Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plans are completed with 25 application-specific BC/DR plans and a bi-annual testing schedule. Vendor Management Policy and Procedures are completed covering vendor lifecycle management and risk-based vendor assessment framework. The Data Governance Policy is in progress with a draft completed awaiting final approval, covering data classification, privacy requirements, and data quality standards. These policy enablers provide clear guidance for governance and management decisions, reducing ambiguity and increasing consistency.

For Tools and Technologies, TechCorp deployed six enabling platforms. The ServiceNow GRC Platform is completed and in production since February 2024, covering risk management, compliance management, policy management, and audit management with 150 licensed users. This platform transformed risk and compliance management from spreadsheets to an integrated, workflow-driven system. The ServiceNow ITSM Platform is completed covering incident, problem, change, service catalog, and configuration management with integrations to 25+ monitoring and collaboration tools. The ITSM platform provides the operational backbone for service delivery. ServiceNow PPM plus Jira for agile teams are completed providing comprehensive portfolio and project management.

Splunk Enterprise Security SIEM is completed with 500+ log sources and 75 correlation searches providing security monitoring, threat detection, and compliance reporting. Splunk transformed security from reactive to proactive by providing real-time threat visibility. Palo Alto Prisma Cloud for Cloud Security Posture Management is completed covering AWS and Azure with continuous compliance monitoring, misconfiguration detection, and automated remediation. The Tenable.io Vulnerability Management Platform is completed with continuous scanning. Three technology enablers are in progress: Okta Enterprise for Identity and Access Management at 75% completion targeting full SSO by Q4 2024, CloudHealth Cloud FinOps Platform at 60% completion targeting Q3 2024, and LeanIX Enterprise Architecture Tool at 50% completion targeting Q4 2024. These platform enablers provide the technological foundation for efficient, scalable governance execution.

For Skills and Competencies, TechCorp deployed six skill development enablers. COBIT 2019 Foundation Training is completed with 45 IT leaders and governance team members trained and 12 achieving COBIT certification. This training ensured leadership understands the framework they're implementing. The Cloud Certifications Program is in progress with 32 of a 50-certification target achieved across AWS, Azure, and GCP, providing the cloud skills essential for TechCorp's cloud-first strategy. Cybersecurity Skills Development is completed with 18 certifications achieved across CISSP, CISM, Security+, and CEH. Agile and DevOps Training is completed with 200 IT staff trained and certifications in Certified Scrum Master and DevOps Foundation. Risk Management Training is completed with 85 risk owners and first-line risk personnel trained. Data Privacy and GDPR Training is completed as mandatory for all IT staff with 98% completion rate. These skill enablers ensure people have the competencies to execute their governance and management responsibilities effectively.

For Culture and Behavior, TechCorp deployed six cultural enablers with mixed status reflecting the longer timelines required for cultural change. The Governance Culture Initiative is in progress including town halls explaining governance value, governance champions in each business unit, and awareness campaigns. The goal is embedding a governance mindset where people see governance as enabling rather than constraining. The Cybersecurity Awareness Program is completed with monthly phishing simulations averaging 5% click rate down from 22% at program start, quarterly security awareness training, and a security champions network of 50 people across the organization. This program successfully raised security awareness and changed behaviors. The Continuous Improvement Program is in progress implementing retrospectives after major initiatives, kaizen events for process improvements, and improvement boards tracking suggestions, with a target of 100 improvements implemented annually. Customer-Centric Service Culture is in progress with service design thinking training, customer journey mapping workshops, and metrics tracking customer satisfaction and NPS. These cultural enablers are shifting mindsets from technology-centric to business-value-centric thinking, though progress is slower than technical enablers because culture change requires sustained effort over time.

## Slide 3: Video Demo Narrative

### Video Title: Tracking Enabler Deployment in the COBIT 2019 Platform

### Video Notes:

**Reference Implementation: TechCorp Financial Services**

Welcome to our demonstration of Step 9: Enabler Deployment in the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. In this reference implementation, we review how TechCorp Financial Services deployed the policies, tools, skills, and cultural elements that enable people to execute governance effectively. Let's navigate to Step 9: Enabler Deployment from the main dashboard. The platform displays an enabler tracking interface organized into four categories: Policies and Procedures, Tools and Technologies, Skills and Competencies, and Culture and Behavior. Each category shows enablers with their deployment status, target completion dates, and related objectives.

We start with Policies and Procedures. We click to expand this section and see TechCorp's eight policy enablers. Let's examine the IT Governance Policy. We click on it and a detailed view opens showing Status: Completed, Version: 2.1, Approval Date: March 2024, Approving Body: Board of Directors, Description: "Defines governance framework, principles, structures, roles, decision rights, and escalation procedures. Provides constitutional foundation for all governance activities." We see Related Objectives: EDM01, APO01, APO12, APO13. We also see an Artifacts section where the actual policy document is attached. We click to download the IT Governance Policy PDF and review it. The platform stores the authoritative version, ensuring people access current, approved policies rather than outdated drafts.

We review TechCorp's other policy enablers. For the Information Security Policy Framework, we see it's marked Completed with 15 individual security policies listed: Access Control Policy, Encryption Policy, Incident Response Policy, Vendor Security Policy, and others. Each sub-policy has its own version, approval date, and next review date. The platform tracks policy review cycles automatically. For the Data Governance Policy, we see Status: In Progress at 85% completion, with a note: "Draft completed and under legal review. Awaiting final approval from Data Governance Council expected October 2024." This transparency shows stakeholders that data governance policy is coming and when to expect it.

Now we move to Tools and Technologies. We expand this section and see TechCorp's six technology enablers. We click on the ServiceNow GRC Platform and see Status: Completed, Go-Live Date: February 2024, Users: 150 licenses, Modules: Risk Management, Compliance Management, Policy Management, Audit Management, Integration Status: Integrated with ITSM, integrated with Active Directory for SSO, integrated with Splunk for security events. We see an Adoption Metrics section showing current usage: 142 of 150 licenses actively used (95% utilization), 45 active IT risks in the system, 127 compliance obligations tracked, 58 policies published. These adoption metrics show the tool is not just deployed but actively used, demonstrating value.

We review TechCorp's other technology enablers. For Okta Enterprise IAM, we see Status: In Progress at 75% completion, Target Completion: Q4 2024, Deployment Milestones showing Phase 1 Core Applications SSO completed (35 applications), Phase 2 Extended Applications SSO in progress (estimated 60 additional applications), Phase 3 Multi-Factor Authentication rollout planned (scheduled for November 2024). This phased deployment tracking helps teams and stakeholders understand progress and remaining work. For the LeanIX Enterprise Architecture Tool, we see Status: In Progress at 50% completion with notes: "Platform deployed, architecture team trained, initial data migration underway. Architecture repository population expected to take 6 months to reach 80% coverage target."

We move to Skills and Competencies. We expand this section and see TechCorp's six skill development enablers. We click on COBIT 2019 Foundation Training and see Status: Completed, Participants: 45 IT leaders and governance team members, Training Delivery: Mix of instructor-led and online, Certifications Achieved: 12 COBIT Foundation certificates, Training Date Range: April-June 2024, Training Vendor: ISACA-accredited training partner. We see a Skill Assessment section showing pre-training and post-training assessment scores: average pre-training score was 52%, average post-training score was 88%, demonstrating significant knowledge gain. We also see an Application Assessment conducted 90 days after training showing that 78% of participants are applying learned concepts in their work, validating training effectiveness.

We review TechCorp's Cloud Certifications Program. We see Status: In Progress, Target: 50 cloud certifications by year-end, Current: 32 certifications achieved (64% of target), Breakdown: 18 AWS certifications (Solutions Architect, Developer, SysOps), 10 Azure certifications (Administrator, Developer), 4 GCP certifications (Cloud Engineer). We see a certification pipeline showing 12 additional engineers currently studying with exams scheduled, projecting 44 certifications by year-end, 88% of the 50-certification target. The platform tracks individual certification status—we can drill down to see which engineers have which certifications, helping leadership understand skill distribution across teams and identify gaps.

For Cybersecurity Skills Development, we see Status: Completed with 18 certifications achieved: 6 CISSP, 4 CISM, 5 Security+, 3 CEH. We see that security team certification coverage is 72% (18 of 25 security team members certified), with a plan to reach 90% coverage by Q2 2025. For Agile and DevOps Training, we see Status: Completed with 200 IT staff trained, representing 67% of the 300-person IT organization. We see that all development teams (12 teams) have at least 80% of team members trained in Agile methodologies, ensuring teams can work effectively in Agile mode.

Finally, we review Culture and Behavior enablers. We expand this section and see TechCorp's six cultural enablers. We click on the Cybersecurity Awareness Program and see Status: Completed, Program Elements: Monthly phishing simulations, quarterly security awareness training, security champions network (50 champions), security incident reporting campaign. We see Effectiveness Metrics: Phishing click rate reduced from 22% baseline to 5% current (77% improvement), security incident reporting increased by 150% (people now report suspicious activity rather than ignoring it), security-related help desk tickets decreased by 30% (people making fewer security mistakes). These metrics demonstrate that the awareness program changed behaviors, not just provided training.

We review TechCorp's Governance Culture Initiative and see Status: In Progress at 40% completion. Activities include: quarterly governance town halls explaining governance value and progress (2 of 4 completed), governance champions program with 12 business unit champions identified and trained (50% of target), governance awareness campaign with posters, intranet articles, and executive messages (ongoing). We see Early Results: governance awareness survey shows 68% of IT staff can explain governance purpose (up from 35% baseline), governance effectiveness score improved from 2.8 to 3.2 (14% improvement), but significant work remains to embed governance as cultural norm. The platform tracks that the next governance town hall is scheduled for November 2024 with the topic "How Governance Delivers Business Value."

We review TechCorp's Continuous Improvement Program and see Status: In Progress at 35% completion. Activities include: retrospectives after major initiatives (6 retrospectives conducted, 42 improvement actions identified), kaizen events for process improvements (3 events conducted with 18 improvements implemented), improvement boards in each department (8 of 12 departments have boards operational). We see a pipeline of 87 improvement suggestions submitted by staff, with 24 approved and in implementation, 31 under evaluation, 18 implemented and closed, and 14 rejected with reasons documented. This improvement pipeline demonstrates that continuous improvement is becoming operational, though not yet fully embedded culturally.

The platform provides comprehensive enabler analytics. We navigate to the Enabler Dashboard and see summary statistics: 26 total enablers defined, 16 completed (62%), 10 in progress (38%), 0 planned (everything is at least in progress). We see completion by category: Policies 88%, Tools 50%, Skills 67%, Culture 33%. This visualization clearly shows that policy and skill development are progressing well, tool deployment is moderate, and cultural change is the slowest but progressing. We see a timeline view showing enabler completion over time from Q2 2024 through projected completion in Q2 2025.

We see an Enabler-to-Objective Map showing which objectives are supported by which enablers and identifying any objectives with insufficient enabler support. For example, we see that EDM02 (Benefits Delivery) is supported by the Benefits Realization Policy, ServiceNow PPM tool, Portfolio Management training, and Value-Driven Culture initiative—four enablers across all categories, indicating comprehensive support. However, we see that APO04 (Innovation) is supported by only the Innovation Culture Program (in progress) with no policy, tool, or training enablers yet, indicating a gap. We flag this for discussion with leadership about whether additional enablers are needed for innovation management.

The platform provides return-on-investment tracking for enablers. We see that the ServiceNow GRC Platform cost $250,000 in licensing and implementation but has delivered measurable benefits: risk management efficiency improved by 40% (time spent on risk assessments reduced from 80 hours per quarter to 48 hours), compliance reporting efficiency improved by 60% (compliance reports that took 5 days to compile now take 2 days), and audit preparation time reduced by 50%. These benefits justify the platform investment and demonstrate enabler value. We see similar ROI tracking for the Security Awareness Program: $150,000 investment in program delivery, but security incidents decreased by 35% avoiding estimated $500,000 in incident response costs, and phishing-related incidents decreased by 80% avoiding estimated $200,000 in potential breach costs, resulting in 4.7x ROI in year one.

We export an Enabler Deployment Status Report that documents all 26 enablers with status, completion percentages, adoption metrics, effectiveness measures, and ROI where applicable. This report is presented to the IT Steering Committee quarterly. During the Q3 review, the committee discusses the slower progress on cultural enablers. The CIO explains that cultural change takes longer than tool deployment and that early indicators are positive—awareness is improving, behaviors are beginning to shift, but embedding cultural norms takes sustained effort over 12-18 months. The committee asks about accelerating culture change. The CIO proposes increasing visible executive leadership engagement—having the CEO and business unit leaders actively participate in governance town halls and publicly recognize teams demonstrating good governance behaviors. The committee approves this recommendation and commits to greater visible sponsorship.

With comprehensive enabler deployment underway, TechCorp has transformed governance from design into operational reality. Policies provide guidance, tools provide capability, skills provide competency, and culture provides motivation. Together, these enablers empower people to execute the governance and management objectives defined in earlier steps. As enabler deployment completes in the coming quarters, TechCorp will shift focus to Phase 4: Monitoring and Improvement, ensuring governance operates effectively and continuously improves. The platform continues tracking enabler effectiveness through adoption metrics, utilization data, and impact measures, ensuring enablers remain relevant and valuable as governance matures.
