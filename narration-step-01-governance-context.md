# Step 1: Governance Context - Instructor Narration Script

## Introduction (0:00 - 0:15)

"Welcome to Step 1 of the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. In this tutorial, we'll walk through defining your Governance Context, which is the foundation of your IT governance framework."

## Navigating to Governance Context (0:15 - 0:30)

"First, let's navigate to the Governance Context page. On the left sidebar, you'll see all 13 steps of the COBIT implementation process. Click on 'Step 1: Governance Context' to begin."

## Organization Profile (0:30 - 1:30)

"Now we're on the Governance Context Definition page. The first section is Enterprise Information, where we define our organization's basic details."

"Let's use TechCorp Financial Services as our example organization."

**[As you fill in each field]:**

"In the Organization Name field, I'll enter 'TechCorp Financial Services Inc.' - this is the legal name of our enterprise."

"For Industry, I'm entering 'Banking and Financial Technology' - also known as FinTech. This is important because COBIT tailors its recommendations based on your industry sector."

"In Organization Size, I'll enter '8,500 employees, $3.2B annual revenue.' This gives context for the scale of governance needed."

"Finally, for IT Role, I'm describing IT's strategic position: 'Strategic enabler and core business differentiator for digital banking innovation.' For financial services, IT isn't just a support function - it's central to competitive advantage."

## Enterprise Goals Selection (1:30 - 3:30)

"Next, we move to Enterprise Goals. COBIT uses the Balanced Scorecard framework with four perspectives: Financial, Customer, Internal, and Learning & Growth."

"For TechCorp, we're selecting comprehensive coverage - all 13 enterprise goals. Let me explain why as we select each one:"

### Financial Perspective

"Under Financial Perspective, we're selecting:"

"'Stakeholder value of business investments' - ensuring our IT investments deliver measurable returns."

"'Portfolio of competitive products and services' - using technology to differentiate our offerings."

"'Managed business risk' - critical in financial services for regulatory and operational risks."

"'Compliance with external laws and regulations' - essential for banking, with regulations like SOX, GDPR, and financial sector-specific requirements."

### Customer Perspective

"Moving to Customer Perspective:"

"'Customer-oriented service culture' - delivering exceptional digital banking experiences."

"'Business service continuity and availability' - our online services must be available 24/7."

"'Agility to respond to changing business environment' - the fintech landscape evolves rapidly, and we must adapt quickly."

### Internal Perspective

"For Internal Perspective:"

"'Quality of management information' - executives need accurate, real-time data for decision-making."

"'Optimization of internal business process functionality' - streamlining operations through technology."

"'Optimization of business process costs' - achieving efficiency while maintaining quality."

### Learning & Growth Perspective

"Finally, Learning & Growth Perspective:"

"'Skilled and motivated people' - attracting and retaining top IT talent is crucial."

"'Product and business innovation culture' - fostering continuous innovation in our services."

"'Management of business change programs' - effectively implementing digital transformation initiatives."

## Key Stakeholders (3:30 - 4:30)

"Now let's identify our key stakeholders. In COBIT, stakeholder needs drive governance objectives."

"For TechCorp, our primary stakeholders include:"

**Board of Directors:**
"The Board needs risk oversight, assurance that IT investments align with business strategy, and confidence in regulatory compliance."

**Chief Executive Officer:**
"The CEO wants IT to enable business strategy, create competitive advantage through technology, and deliver clear return on investment."

**Chief Risk Officer:**
"The CRO requires comprehensive risk management, a strong cybersecurity posture, regulatory compliance, and robust business continuity plans."

"We could add more stakeholders like the CIO, CISO, customers, and regulators, but these three provide the core governance perspective."

## Saving the Context (4:30 - 4:45)

"Now that we've defined our governance context, let's save it. Click the 'Save Context' button. This information will now flow through the entire COBIT implementation process."

## Dashboard Verification (4:45 - 5:00)

"Let's verify our changes by returning to the Dashboard. Click on 'Governance Dashboard' in the sidebar."

"Notice how the dashboard now reflects TechCorp's context. You can see our organization name and the enterprise goals we selected."

## Conclusion (5:00 - 5:30)

"Excellent! We've successfully completed Step 1: Governance Context. We've:"
- "Defined our organization profile"
- "Selected all 13 enterprise goals aligned with our strategic objectives"
- "Identified our key stakeholders and their needs"

"This governance context is now the foundation for the next steps: Capability Assessment, where we'll evaluate our current maturity levels, and Governance Design, where we'll tailor the COBIT framework to TechCorp's specific needs."

"In the next tutorial, we'll move to Step 2: Capability Assessment. Thank you for watching!"

## Key Teaching Points

### Why Governance Context Matters
- It ensures IT governance is tailored to your specific organization
- Different industries, sizes, and strategic contexts require different governance approaches
- Stakeholder needs drive the selection of governance and management objectives

### Best Practices
- Be thorough but realistic when selecting enterprise goals
- Only select goals that are truly relevant to your organization
- Stakeholder identification should include diverse perspectives (board, executive, operational)
- Document stakeholder needs specifically - vague requirements lead to vague governance

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Selecting all goals without considering organizational capacity
- Ignoring key stakeholders like the Board or regulators
- Using generic descriptions instead of organization-specific details
- Skipping the stakeholder needs documentation

### Connection to COBIT Framework
- This step implements COBIT's "Understand Enterprise and Governance Context" principle
- The enterprise goals cascade to alignment goals and then to COBIT governance objectives
- Properly defined context ensures the Design Factors in Step 3 are meaningful
