# Step 2: Capability Assessment - Instructor Narration Script

## Introduction (0:00 - 0:15)

"Welcome to Step 2 of the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. In this tutorial, we'll walk through conducting a Capability Assessment, where we evaluate the current maturity of our IT governance processes and set improvement targets."

## Navigating to Capability Assessment (0:15 - 0:30)

"Let's navigate to the Capability Assessment page. On the left sidebar, click on 'Step 2: Capability Assessment'. This step builds on the governance context we defined in Step 1."

## Understanding Process Capability Levels (0:30 - 1:30)

"Before we begin assessing, let's understand the COBIT Process Capability Model. COBIT uses a 0-to-5 maturity scale based on ISO/IEC 15504:"

**Level 0 - Incomplete:** "The process is not implemented or fails to achieve its purpose. There's no evidence of a systematic approach."

**Level 1 - Performed:** "The process achieves its basic purpose. Work gets done, but it's ad-hoc and reactive."

**Level 2 - Managed:** "The process is planned, monitored, and adjusted. We have basic performance management in place."

**Level 3 - Established:** "The process follows a defined standard across the organization. It's documented, communicated, and consistently applied."

**Level 4 - Predictable:** "The process operates within defined limits and produces predictable outcomes. We measure and control process performance."

**Level 5 - Optimizing:** "The process is continuously improved based on quantitative analysis. We're innovating and optimizing."

## Assessment Strategy for Financial Services (1:30 - 2:00)

"For TechCorp Financial Services, we're focusing on seven critical processes that are especially important for financial institutions. These span all five COBIT domains: Evaluate, Direct & Monitor (EDM), Align, Plan & Organize (APO), Build, Acquire & Implement (BAI), Deliver, Service & Support (DSS), and Monitor, Evaluate & Assess (MEA)."

## Process 1: EDM01 - Governance Framework (2:00 - 2:45)

"Let's start with EDM01: Ensured Governance Framework Setting and Maintenance."

**[As you set the levels]:**

"For TechCorp, our current level is 2 - Managed. We have basic governance processes, but they're not yet standardized enterprise-wide."

"Our target is Level 4 - Predictable. Why? Because as a financial services company undergoing digital transformation, our Board needs predictable, measurable governance outcomes."

"That's a gap of 2 levels - significant but achievable over 18-24 months."

"Priority: High. Board oversight is critical for regulatory compliance and stakeholder confidence."

## Process 2: EDM03 - Risk Optimization (2:45 - 3:20)

"Next, EDM03: Ensured Risk Optimization."

"Current: Level 2 - We manage risks reactively."

"Target: Level 5 - Optimizing. For a financial institution, risk management isn't just about compliance - it's a competitive differentiator. We need to continuously optimize our risk posture against evolving cyber threats and regulations."

"Gap: 3 levels - this is our most ambitious target."

"Priority: High. Critical for regulatory compliance, cyber resilience, and customer trust."

## Process 3: APO12 - Managed Risk (3:20 - 3:50)

"APO12: Managed Risk - the operational side of risk management."

"Current: Level 2 - Basic risk identification and response."

"Target: Level 4 - We want predictable, measured risk management across all IT operations."

"Gap: 2 levels."

"Priority: High. Financial services require robust, consistent risk management."

## Process 4: APO13 - Managed Security (3:50 - 4:20)

"APO13: Managed Security - absolutely critical for banking."

"Current: Level 2 - We have security controls, but they're not yet fully integrated."

"Target: Level 5 - Optimizing. Why the highest target? Because we're protecting customer financial data. Security must be continuous optimized against emerging threats."

"Gap: 3 levels."

"Priority: High. Customer data protection is non-negotiable in financial services."

## Process 5: BAI06 - IT Changes (4:20 - 4:50)

"BAI06: Managed IT Changes - controlling how we modify production systems."

"Current: Level 2 - We have change management, but it's not fully predictable."

"Target: Level 4 - We need controlled, predictable change management to ensure stability of our banking platforms."

"Gap: 2 levels."

"Priority: Medium - important, but slightly less critical than security and risk processes."

## Process 6: DSS05 - Security Services (4:50 - 5:20)

"DSS05: Managed Security Services - the operational delivery of security."

"Current: Level 2 - Basic security monitoring and response."

"Target: Level 4 - We need predictable security operations with real-time threat detection and automated response."

"Gap: 2 levels."

"Priority: High. Real-time security is essential for online banking."

## Process 7: MEA03 - External Compliance (5:20 - 5:50)

"Finally, MEA03: Managed Compliance with External Requirements."

"Current: Level 3 - Established. We're actually doing better here - our compliance processes are already standardized."

"Target: Level 4 - Predictable. We want to move from reactive compliance to predictive compliance monitoring."

"Gap: Just 1 level - this should be achievable in 6-12 months."

"Priority: High. We must comply with SOX, GDPR, PCI-DSS, and financial sector regulations."

## Saving the Assessment (5:50 - 6:10)

"Now that we've assessed all seven processes, let's save our capability assessment. Click the 'Save Capability Assessment' button."

"Notice the summary statistics: We've assessed 7 processes, with an average current maturity of Level 2 (Managed), targeting Level 4-5 (Predictable to Optimizing). Six processes are high priority."

## Dashboard Verification (6:10 - 6:30)

"Let's verify our assessment by returning to the Dashboard."

"The dashboard now reflects our capability gaps. This data will flow into the next steps: Governance Design, where we'll tailor COBIT controls, and Priority & Implementation Planning, where we'll roadmap our improvements."

## Conclusion (6:30 - 7:00)

"Excellent! We've successfully completed Step 2: Capability Assessment. We've:"
- "Evaluated 7 critical IT governance processes"
- "Documented current maturity levels (mostly Level 2)"
- "Set ambitious but achievable targets (Level 4-5)"
- "Identified capability gaps ranging from 1 to 3 levels"
- "Prioritized our improvement efforts"

"This capability baseline is crucial. It tells us where we are today and where we need to be. In Step 3, we'll use this information to design a tailored governance framework that addresses these specific gaps."

"Thank you for watching! In the next tutorial, we'll move to Step 3: Governance Design."

## Key Teaching Points

### Why Capability Assessment Matters
- Provides an objective baseline of current governance maturity
- Identifies specific improvement opportunities
- Enables data-driven prioritization of governance investments
- Creates accountability by setting measurable targets
- Aligns IT maturity with business risk appetite and compliance requirements

### Best Practices for Capability Assessment
- **Be realistic about current state** - Don't overestimate maturity to avoid disappointing stakeholders
- **Set stretch but achievable targets** - Most organizations can improve 1-2 levels in 12-18 months
- **Focus on critical processes** - Don't assess all 40 COBIT processes; prioritize based on enterprise goals
- **Involve process owners** - Assessment should include input from those who execute the processes
- **Consider industry benchmarks** - Financial services typically target Level 3-4 for critical processes
- **Link to business outcomes** - Connect capability improvements to enterprise goals from Step 1

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
- **Assessing too many processes** - Focus on the critical few aligned with your enterprise goals
- **Setting unrealistic targets** - Jumping from Level 1 to Level 5 is rarely achievable
- **Ignoring current state** - Honestly assess where you are, not where you wish you were
- **Missing stakeholder input** - Include process owners, not just management perspectives
- **Forgetting the "why"** - Always document the rationale for target levels
- **Treating all processes equally** - Use priority levels to focus effort and investment

### Assessment Criteria Quick Reference

**Level 2 (Managed) indicators:**
- Processes have defined owners
- Basic planning and monitoring occurs
- Performance is measured
- Adjustments are made when issues arise

**Level 3 (Established) indicators:**
- Standard process defined and documented
- Process is communicated and training provided
- Process is enforced consistently
- Work products meet standards

**Level 4 (Predictable) indicators:**
- Process performance is measured quantitatively
- Process operates within defined control limits
- Process capability is known and understood
- Quality and process performance objectives are established

**Level 5 (Optimizing) indicators:**
- Quantitative process improvement targets are set
- Continuous improvement is part of the culture
- Innovation is pursued based on data analysis
- Process effectiveness and efficiency are continuously improved

### Connection to COBIT Framework
- Implements COBIT's "Ensure Continuous Improvement" principle
- Uses ISO/IEC 15504-based capability model (0-5 scale)
- Focus on process capability, not organizational maturity
- Each process can be at different capability levels
- Target levels should align with risk appetite and compliance needs
- Capability gaps drive the design factors in Step 3

### Financial Services Context
- **Regulatory drivers:** SOX, GDPR, PCI-DSS, FFIEC, GLBA, Basel III
- **Typical target levels:** Level 3-4 for most processes, Level 4-5 for security and risk
- **Key focus areas:** Risk management, information security, compliance, change management
- **Audit expectations:** Clear evidence of process capability and improvement trajectory
- **Board reporting:** Capability levels provide clear KPIs for governance oversight
