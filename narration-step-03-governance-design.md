## Introduction (0:00-0:08)

"Welcome to this demonstration of the COBIT 2019 governance design process. Today we'll walk through the complete workflow for TechCorp Financial Services, a banking organization implementing COBIT 2019 to strengthen their IT governance framework."

---

## PART 1: Step 1 - Governance Context (0:08-0:20)

"We begin with Step 1, establishing the governance context. For TechCorp Financial Services, a banking organization with 8,500 employees and 3.2 billion dollars in annual revenue, we're defining the foundational information that will drive all subsequent governance decisions."

**As fields are being filled:**

"Notice how we capture the organization's name, industry classification as Banking and Financial Technology, size metrics, and most importantly, the IT role. For TechCorp, IT serves as a strategic enabler and core business differentiator for their digital banking innovation initiatives."

**As enterprise goals are selected:**

"Next, we select the key enterprise goals from the Balanced Scorecard framework. For a financial services organization, we focus on managed business risk, compliance with external laws and regulations, agility to respond to changing business environment, optimization of internal business processes, and fostering a product and business innovation culture. These five goals will cascade down to inform our governance and management objectives."

**After Save Context is clicked:**

"And we save this governance context. This establishes the foundation for our entire COBIT implementation."

## PART 2: Step 2 - Capability Assessment (0:20-0:35)

"Moving to Step 2, we perform a capability assessment of our key COBIT processes. Based on TechCorp's enterprise goals, we're assessing seven critical processes across the governance and management domains."

**As assessments are being filled:**

"For each process, we document three key elements: current maturity level on the ISO 15504 scale from zero to five, target maturity level aligned with strategic objectives, and implementation priority. Notice how TechCorp's current state is predominantly at Level 2, Managed, with targets of Level 4 or 5."

**Examples being filled:**

"EDM01, Ensured Governance Framework Setting and Maintenance - currently Level 2, targeting Level 4, high priority. The gap of two levels indicates significant work needed to strengthen board oversight for digital transformation.

APO13, Managed Security - also Level 2, but targeting Level 5, Optimizing, reflecting the critical nature of cybersecurity in the financial sector.

MEA03, Managed Compliance - currently at Level 3, Established, targeting Level 4, showing some existing maturity in regulatory compliance processes."

**After assessment is saved:**

"These gap assessments quantify where TechCorp needs to focus their improvement efforts. We save this data, which now flows into our governance design."

## PART 3: Step 3 - Governance Design (0:35-1:05)

"Now we arrive at Step 3, Governance Design, where we tailor the COBIT framework using the seven design factors. This customization ensures our governance approach fits TechCorp's specific context."

**Design Factor 1 - Enterprise Strategy:**

"First, enterprise strategy. We document TechCorp's digital transformation vision: becoming a leading online financial services provider through mobile banking expansion, fintech partnerships, legacy system modernization, and AI/ML adoption for personalized experiences and fraud detection."

**Design Factor 2 - Enterprise Goals Alignment:**

"Next, goals alignment. We articulate how the selected enterprise goals translate to IT priorities. Financial goals drive robust governance and risk frameworks. Customer goals require flexible architecture. Internal goals prioritize cybersecurity. And learning goals support emerging technology adoption."

**Design Factor 3 - Risk Profile:**

"The risk profile reflects TechCorp's conservative appetite due to regulatory oversight and fiduciary responsibilities. Primary concerns include cyber threats, operational disruptions, regulatory non-compliance, fraud, and third-party vendor risks."

**Design Factor 4 - IT Role:**

"We select Strategic as the IT role, confirming that technology is both a critical enabler and business differentiator for TechCorp."

**Design Factor 5 - Compliance Requirements:**

"Compliance requirements are extensive in banking. We document six key regulations: Sarbanes-Oxley Act, GDPR for data protection, PCI-DSS for payment security, Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act for financial privacy, FFIEC guidelines, and Basel III capital requirements."

**Design Factor 6 - Threat Landscape:**

"The threat landscape acknowledges TechCorp as a high-value target. We document increasing sophistication in ransomware and phishing attacks, state-sponsored APT threats, DDoS risks, and insider threats from privileged access."

**Design Factor 7 - Technology Adoption:**

"Finally, technology adoption describes TechCorp's cloud-first strategy with hybrid deployment, AI/ML for fraud detection, zero-trust security architecture, API-driven microservices, and DevSecOps practices."

**After Save Governance Design is clicked:**

"We save the governance design. These seven design factors now provide the customization parameters that will influence which COBIT components, practices, and structures are most relevant for TechCorp's specific situation."

## Conclusion (1:05-1:10)

"We've completed the integrated workflow: establishing context, assessing capability gaps, and designing a tailored governance framework. These three foundational steps prepare TechCorp to move forward with selecting specific governance and management objectives in Step 4, which will be filtered and prioritized based on everything we've defined here."

## Key Teaching Points

### Why This Workflow Matters

1. **Sequential Dependencies:** Steps 1→2→3 build upon each other. Context informs assessment, assessment informs design.

2. **Customization Over Templates:** COBIT 2019's design factor approach ensures governance fits the organization, not the other way around.

3. **Evidence-Based Decisions:** The capability assessment provides quantitative gap analysis that justifies investment priorities.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Skipping Context:** Many organizations jump straight to selecting objectives without establishing context. This leads to generic, ineffective governance.

2. **Unrealistic Targets:** Setting all processes to Level 5 is neither necessary nor cost-effective. Target levels should align with enterprise goals and risk appetite.

3. **Superficial Design Factors:** Filling design factors with boilerplate text misses the customization opportunity. These should reflect genuine organizational characteristics.

### Industry-Specific Insights (Financial Services)

- **Regulatory Drivers:** Compliance requirements heavily influence financial sector governance design. Notice the six regulations documented for TechCorp.

- **Conservative Risk Profile:** Banking organizations typically have lower risk tolerance, driving higher target maturity levels for risk and security processes (Level 4-5).

- **Strategic IT Role:** Modern financial services recognize technology as competitive differentiator, not just support function. This elevates governance importance.

### Technical Notes

- **Balanced Scorecard Integration:** Enterprise goals use BSC perspectives (Financial, Customer, Internal, Learning) to ensure balanced coverage.

- **ISO/IEC 15504 Scale:** The 0-5 capability levels provide industry-standard measurement for process maturity.

- **Design Factor Interdependencies:** Enterprise strategy, goals alignment, and IT role should tell a consistent story. Conflicts indicate incomplete analysis.
