# COBIT 2019 Step 4: Governance Objectives - Video Narration Script
## TechCorp Financial Services Inc. - EDM Domain Selection

**Duration:** ~7-8 seconds
**Audience:** IT Governance Professionals, Auditors, Board Members
**Pace:** Moderate, focused on governance framework

---

## Introduction (0:00-0:02)

"In Step 4, we select and configure governance objectives from the EDM domain - Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor. These are board-level processes that ensure TechCorp's IT governance framework is properly established and maintained."

---

## EDM01: Governance Framework (0:02-0:03)

**As EDM01 is selected:**

"First, EDM01 - Ensured Governance Framework Setting and Maintenance. This is critical for TechCorp as it provides the foundation for all other governance activities. We enable this objective and implement all three practices: evaluate the governance system, direct the governance system, and monitor the governance system. This addresses TechCorp's need for board oversight of their digital transformation initiatives."

---

## EDM02: Benefits Delivery (0:03-0:04)

**As EDM02 is selected:**

"EDM02 - Ensured Benefits Delivery. This objective ensures that IT investments deliver expected value aligned with enterprise goals. For TechCorp's 3.2 billion dollar revenue operation, we implement 2 of 3 practices, focusing on evaluating and directing benefits optimization while building monitoring capabilities."

---

## EDM03: Risk Optimization (0:04-0:05)

**As EDM03 is selected:**

"EDM03 - Ensured Risk Optimization is paramount for a banking organization. Given TechCorp's exposure to cyber threats, regulatory requirements, and operational risks, we implement all three practices at full maturity. This provides board-level risk oversight across cybersecurity, compliance, and business continuity."

---

## EDM04: Resource Optimization (0:05-0:06)

**As EDM04 is selected:**

"EDM04 - Ensured Resource Optimization ensures IT resources are allocated effectively. We implement 2 of 3 practices, focusing on evaluating and directing resource management for TechCorp's 8,500 employee organization."

---

## EDM05: Stakeholder Engagement (0:06-0:07)

**As EDM05 is selected:**

"Finally, EDM05 - Ensured Stakeholder Engagement. We implement one foundational practice to establish board-level stakeholder communication channels, essential for transparent governance reporting."

---

## Summary and Save (0:07-0:08)

**As configuration is saved:**

"We've now configured all 5 EDM objectives with 11 of 15 practices implemented - a 73% implementation rate. This balanced approach focuses resources on governance framework establishment and risk management while building capabilities in benefits delivery, resource optimization, and stakeholder engagement.

Notice the summary shows 5 of 5 objectives enabled. These governance-level processes, performed by TechCorp's board and executive team, will now cascade down to inform which management objectives we select in Step 5."

## Key Teaching Points

### Why EDM Objectives Matter

1. **Board-Level Accountability:** EDM processes are the ONLY processes in COBIT performed by the governing body, not management. This distinguishes governance FROM management.

2. **Top-Down Alignment:** The 5 EDM objectives establish the framework that all 35+ management objectives (APO, BAI, DSS, MEA) operate within.

3. **Evaluate-Direct-Monitor Pattern:** Each EDM objective follows the same structure:
   - Evaluate: Assess options and make decisions
   - Direct: Assign responsibility and provide direction
   - Monitor: Measure performance and conformance

### Prioritization Rationale for TechCorp

**Full Implementation (3/3 practices):**
- **EDM01 (Governance Framework):** Foundational - must establish framework before anything else
- **EDM03 (Risk Optimization):** Critical for financial sector regulatory compliance and cyber risk management

**Partial Implementation (2/3 practices):**
- **EDM02 (Benefits Delivery):** Important for investment justification but building maturity gradually
- **EDM04 (Resource Optimization):** Needed for efficiency but not urgent given TechCorp's financial position

**Minimal Implementation (1/3 practices):**
- **EDM05 (Stakeholder Engagement):** Foundational communication established; advanced practices deferred

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Implementing All Practices Immediately:** Organizations often try to implement all 15 practices at once. This dilutes focus and resources. TechCorp's 73% approach is more realistic.

2. **Confusing EDM with APO01:** EDM01 (board-level governance framework) is often confused with APO01 (management-level governance framework execution). They're complementary but distinct.

3. **Underestimating EDM03:** Many organizations treat risk as a management concern. COBIT explicitly places risk optimization at the board level for good reason - ultimate accountability rests there.

### Industry-Specific Insights (Financial Services)

- **Regulatory Alignment:** EDM processes map directly to regulatory expectations. SOX requires board governance oversight (EDM01), Basel III requires board risk oversight (EDM03), GLBA requires stakeholder transparency (EDM05).

- **Audit Expectations:** External auditors and bank examiners will review evidence of EDM implementation. Board minutes, risk committee charters, and governance policies demonstrate EDM01/EDM03 maturity.

- **Conservative Implementation:** TechCorp's decision to implement all EDM03 practices reflects the high-stakes nature of banking. Compare this to a less-regulated industry that might implement 1/3 or 2/3.

### Technical Notes

- **EDM Scope:** Only 5 objectives (EDM01-05) compared to 35+ management objectives (APO, BAI, DSS, MEA). This reflects the strategic vs. operational nature of governance.

- **Practice Granularity:** Each EDM objective has exactly 3 practices (Evaluate, Direct, Monitor). This consistency makes the framework easy to understand and apply.

- **Implementation Percentages:** The 73% rate (11/15) is realistic for initial implementation. Organizations typically:
  - Year 1: 60-70% (foundational practices)
  - Year 2: 80-90% (expanding coverage)
  - Year 3+: 90-100% (optimization)

### Linkage to Previous Steps

**From Step 1 (Context):** TechCorp's enterprise goals (managed business risk, compliance, agility) directly justify the emphasis on EDM01 and EDM03.

**From Step 2 (Assessment):** The EDM01 gap (Current L2 → Target L4) drives the decision to implement all 3 practices immediately.

**From Step 3 (Design):** The risk profile (conservative appetite, extensive compliance requirements) explains the full EDM03 implementation.

### Next Steps Preview

"The governance objectives selected here will inform Step 5, where we'll select management objectives from 35+ options across four domains:
- APO (Align, Plan, Organize) - 14 objectives
- BAI (Build, Acquire, Implement) - 11 objectives
- DSS (Deliver, Service, Support) - 6 objectives
- MEA (Monitor, Evaluate, Assess) - 4 objectives

The 5 EDM objectives provide the governance framework, while the management objectives provide the operational execution."
