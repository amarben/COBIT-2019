## Video Narration

Welcome to our demonstration of Step 2: Capability Assessment using the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. In this walkthrough, we'll see how TechCorp Financial Services documented their capability assessment results. We begin by navigating from the main dashboard to Step 2: Capability Assessment. The platform presents a comprehensive interface showing all 40 COBIT objectives organized by domain. We see the EDM section first, followed by APO, BAI, DSS, and MEA. Each objective displays key information: the objective code, name, current capability level, target capability level, gap, and priority.

### Assessing EDM01: Governance Framework

Let's start by assessing our first governance objective. We click on EDM01: Ensured Governance Framework Setting and Maintenance. A detailed assessment form opens. We see fields for Current Capability Level, Target Capability Level, Priority, and a Rationale text area. The platform provides a dropdown for Current Capability Level with options from 0 to 5, each labeled with its maturity name: 0-Incomplete, 1-Performed, 2-Managed, 3-Established, 4-Predictable, 5-Optimizing. We select level 2 (Managed) because TechCorp has basic governance structures in place—an IT steering committee meets regularly, there's a governance policy, but processes aren't fully standardized or predictable.

Now we set the Target Capability Level. We select 4 (Predictable) because TechCorp wants governance that operates within defined limits, is measured and controlled, and reliably achieves outcomes. We're not targeting level 5 (Optimizing) for this objective right now because continuous optimization can come later once predictability is achieved. The platform automatically calculates the gap: 2 levels. This quantifies the improvement required. We set Priority to High because governance framework is foundational—without this, other improvements struggle. In the Rationale field, we document our reasoning: "Basic governance structures exist but lack standardization and predictability. Need formal governance charter and consistent application." This rationale ensures future readers understand why these ratings were assigned.

We click Save and the assessment for EDM01 is recorded. The platform updates the summary view, showing EDM01 with current 2, target 4, gap 2, priority High.

### Assessing EDM02: Benefits Delivery

We continue with the next objective, EDM02: Ensured Benefits Delivery. We click to open the assessment form. This one is particularly challenging—TechCorp honestly acknowledges they have virtually no systematic benefits tracking. Individual project managers might track some metrics, but there's no enterprise-wide benefits realization process. We select Current Capability Level 1 (Performed). The process purpose is achieved occasionally but it's ad-hoc and reactive. For target, we again select 4 (Predictable) because stakeholders demand clear evidence of IT value delivery. This creates a 3-level gap, the largest in our assessment. Priority is High because this directly impacts stakeholder confidence and portfolio optimization decisions.

We document the rationale: "Limited benefits tracking for IT investments. Need structured portfolio value management and benefits realization processes." We save this assessment and move to EDM03: Ensured Risk Optimization. Here, TechCorp is stronger—they have a mature risk management function and integrated IT risks into the enterprise risk register. We select Current Capability 3 (Established) because risk processes are formally defined and consistently followed. Target is 4, creating a 1-level gap. Priority remains High given the financial services regulatory environment. Rationale: "Strong risk management foundation but needs better integration with enterprise risk management and predictive risk analytics."

### Continuing Through All Domains

We continue through all five EDM objectives, then move to the APO domain. The platform displays 14 APO objectives. Let's assess APO13: Managed Security, a high-priority objective for TechCorp. We click to open the form. TechCorp has comprehensive security policies, a Security Operations Center, regular security assessments, and integration with risk management. This merits Current Capability 3 (Established). However, as a financial services firm and high-value target, TechCorp targets level 5 (Optimizing) for security—they want continuous improvement, threat intelligence integration, and proactive security posture. This creates a 2-level gap. Priority is High. Rationale documents their security maturity journey and the need for zero trust architecture and advanced threat protection.

We assess APO07: Managed Human Resources. TechCorp's 14% turnover rate and recruitment challenges indicate HR processes need improvement. Current Capability is 2 (Managed)—there are processes for recruiting and onboarding, but they're not optimized. Target is 4 (Predictable) because talent is critical to TechCorp's digital strategy. Gap is 2 levels. Priority is High. We document concerns about talent retention and the need for competency frameworks and career development programs. As we work through APO objectives, we see varying maturity—some like APO02 (Strategy) are relatively strong at level 3, while others like APO04 (Innovation) are weak at level 1.

Moving to the BAI domain, we assess 11 objectives related to building and implementing solutions. BAI03 (Solutions Identification and Build) scores well at 3 because TechCorp has embraced Agile methodologies and development practices are mature. However, BAI05 (Organizational Change Management) scores poorly at 1—TechCorp admits they focus on technical implementation but neglect organizational change, explaining why projects deliver technology but don't always achieve business outcomes. This is marked Medium priority for now but will move to High in future phases. BAI11 (Projects) is assessed at 2 with target 4, explaining the 73% on-time delivery rate. The platform makes it easy to see patterns—BAI domain shows strong technical delivery but weak organizational enablement.

The DSS domain is TechCorp's strength. We assess DSS01 (Operations) at level 3—operations are well-defined, documented, and consistently executed. Target is 4, showing there's still room for improvement toward predictable, measured operations. DSS02 (Service Requests and Incidents) is also 3—the ServiceNow ITSM platform provides structure and consistency. DSS05 (Security Services) is 3, reflecting the 24/7 Security Operations Center. All six DSS objectives are assessed at level 3, indicating operational maturity. However, all target level 4 or 5, showing TechCorp's commitment to operational excellence.

Finally, we assess the MEA domain. MEA02 (Internal Control System) scores 3, reflecting years of SOX compliance work. MEA03 (External Compliance) also scores 3—TechCorp has compliance processes for GDPR, PCI-DSS, and other regulations, though two recent audit findings indicate gaps. Target is 5 for MEA03 because regulatory violations in financial services can be catastrophic. MEA01 (Performance Monitoring) scores only 2—while some performance metrics exist, there's no comprehensive performance monitoring framework. This is a key gap to address.

### Summary Analytics and Reporting

After completing all 40 assessments, the platform generates summary analytics. We see a dashboard showing average capability by domain, the distribution of high/medium/low priorities, and a heat map visualizing gaps. The overall average current capability is 2.4, target is 4.0, average gap is 1.6 levels. We have 22 high-priority gaps, 13 medium-priority gaps, and 5 low-priority gaps. This data-driven view helps leadership understand the improvement journey ahead and supports budget requests for governance investments.

The platform provides an export function—we generate a capability assessment report in PDF format. This report includes detailed rationales for each assessment, summary statistics, and gap analysis visualizations. We share this report with the IT Steering Committee, who review and validate the assessment. They challenge a few ratings and we adjust based on additional evidence discussed. The final, validated assessment becomes the official baseline. We'll repeat this assessment every six months to measure improvement progress. The platform tracks assessment history, allowing us to see trends over time—which objectives are improving, which remain stuck, and whether our improvement initiatives are effective. This capability assessment is not a one-time exercise but an ongoing management tool that keeps governance improvement grounded in objective measurement and continuous learning.
