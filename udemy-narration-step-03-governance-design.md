## Video Narration

Welcome to our demonstration of Step 3: Governance Design in the COBIT 2019 Implementation Platform. In this session, we'll walk through how TechCorp Financial Services documented their governance system design, creating a blueprint that guides all subsequent implementation activities. Let's begin by navigating to Step 3: Governance Design from the main dashboard. The platform presents a clean interface organized into three main sections: Governance Principles, Governance Structures, and Design Documentation. We'll work through each section to fully document TechCorp's governance design.

### Governance Principles Section

We start with Governance Principles, the foundational values that guide all governance decisions and behaviors. The platform displays a section where we can add multiple principles. We click "Add Principle" and a form appears with fields for Principle Name and Principle Description. For our first principle, we enter the name: "Value-Driven Decision Making." In the description field, we document: "All IT decisions must demonstrably support enterprise goals and deliver measurable business value. Governance focuses on outcomes and benefits, not just compliance or control. Every significant investment requires a clear value proposition tied to strategic objectives." We click Save and the principle appears in our list.

We add our second principle by clicking "Add Principle" again. This time we enter "Risk-Aware Innovation." The description states: "Governance balances innovation speed with appropriate risk management and compliance. We take calculated risks within defined appetite rather than avoiding all risk. Risk considerations inform decisions but do not paralyze action." We continue adding principles three through six: Stakeholder-Centric Engagement, Clear Accountability, Agile Governance Processes, and Data-Informed Management. Each principle includes a detailed description explaining what it means in practice and how it guides behavior. The platform displays all six principles in a clear list that can be referenced throughout the implementation journey. These principles will be published in TechCorp's Governance Charter and reinforced in all governance communications.

### Governance Structures Section

Now we move to the Governance Structures section. This is where we document the organizational bodies, committees, and roles that comprise TechCorp's governance system. The platform provides a structured approach to documenting each governance body. We click "Add Governance Structure" and a comprehensive form opens. For our first structure, we document the IT Steering Committee. We enter the Structure Name: "IT Steering Committee." In the Purpose field, we write: "Provides strategic direction for IT investments, approves major initiatives, prioritizes portfolio, and ensures alignment between IT and enterprise strategy."

We continue filling out the form. For Chair, we enter: "Chief Executive Officer (CEO)." The Members field allows us to list all participants: "CFO, CRO, CIO, and Business Unit Leaders." We set Meeting Frequency to "Monthly." In the Decision Authority field, we specify what this committee can decide: "Strategic IT direction, investment approvals over $1M, portfolio prioritization, resource allocation between major initiatives, escalated architectural and technology decisions." We add reporting relationships: "Reports directly to Board of Directors with quarterly governance updates." In the Charter Status field, we select "Approved" from a dropdown and note the approval date. We click Save and the IT Steering Committee structure is documented.

We repeat this process for the Technology Risk Committee. We document its purpose as risk oversight, list the CRO as chair with members including CIO, CISO, CCO, and an external risk expert, set frequency to bi-weekly, define its authority over risk appetite, risk treatment decisions, and cybersecurity policies, and note it reports to the Board Audit Committee. We continue documenting the Architecture Review Board, specifying that it meets weekly, is chaired by the Chief Architect, includes domain architects and senior engineers, and has authority to approve or reject architecture proposals and set technical standards. The Change Advisory Board is documented with its bi-weekly meeting cadence, cross-functional membership, and authority over change approvals. Finally, we document the Portfolio Management Office as a continuous operational body responsible for portfolio optimization and benefits tracking.

The platform now displays all five governance structures in an organized view. We can see at a glance the governance system's multi-tiered design with strategic, risk, and operational governance bodies. Each structure shows its key attributes—chair, frequency, decision authority. This visualization helps stakeholders understand how governance works at TechCorp and where different decisions are made. We can click on any structure to view full details or edit as the governance system evolves. The platform also provides an organization chart view, showing how these bodies relate to each other and the enterprise reporting structure.

### Design Documentation Section

Next, we navigate to the Design Documentation section where we capture additional governance design elements that don't fit neatly into principles or structures. We see fields for Decision-Making Frameworks, Reporting Mechanisms, Integration Approach, and Implementation Roadmap. In the Decision-Making Frameworks field, we document TechCorp's Decision Rights Matrix approach. We write: "TechCorp uses a RACI-based Decision Rights Matrix defining who has authority for different decision types. Strategic investments over $5M require IT Steering Committee approval. Investments $1M-$5M require CIO approval with IT Steering Committee notification. Operational changes follow risk-based approval: standard changes approved by change coordinators, normal changes by Change Advisory Board, high-risk changes by CIO, emergency changes via specific protocol with post-implementation review. Architecture decisions require Architecture Review Board approval for all initiatives. Portfolio prioritization decisions made by IT Steering Committee based on PMO recommendations."

In the Reporting Mechanisms field, we detail the tiered reporting approach. We document what each stakeholder group receives, at what frequency, covering what topics. We explain that the Board gets quarterly governance dashboards, the IT Steering Committee monthly portfolio reports, the Risk Committee bi-weekly risk reports, and business units monthly service performance reports. We note that all reports are generated from integrated dashboards in ServiceNow GRC and PowerBI, ensuring consistency and reducing manual effort. We also document communication protocols for incidents and issues—when stakeholders are notified, through what channels, and what escalation procedures apply.

For Integration Approach, we document how governance integrates with other enterprise systems. We write: "IT governance integrates with Enterprise Risk Management using shared risk taxonomy, methodology, and GRC platform. IT risks managed alongside enterprise risks in same register. IT governance integrates with strategic planning—IT strategy developed in parallel with enterprise strategy, approved by IT Steering Committee, aligned with annual planning cycle. IT governance integrates with financial management—IT budget part of enterprise budget process, same financial systems, aligned reporting. IT governance integrates with compliance management—IT compliance tracked in GRC platform with enterprise compliance obligations, coordinated audit planning." This integration documentation prevents governance from becoming siloed and ensures efficient coordination.

Finally, we document the Implementation Roadmap, outlining how TechCorp will implement the designed governance system. We note: "Governance implementation will follow phased approach. Phase 1 (Q2-Q3 2024): Establish foundational governance structures—IT Steering Committee operational, Technology Risk Committee formed, governance charter approved. Phase 2 (Q3-Q4 2024): Operationalize governance processes—portfolio management active, risk reporting established, performance dashboards deployed. Phase 3 (Q4 2024-Q1 2025): Expand and mature governance—Architecture Review Board mature, benefits realization framework implemented, stakeholder engagement routines established. Phase 4 (Q1-Q2 2025): Optimize and integrate—governance processes predictable and measured, continuous improvement active, full integration with enterprise systems." This roadmap sets expectations for stakeholders and guides implementation teams.

### Finalizing and Exporting

With all sections completed, we click Save on the Design Documentation page. The platform now contains a comprehensive governance design for TechCorp, covering principles, structures, decision rights, reporting, integration, and implementation approach. We can export this as a Governance Design Document, a formal deliverable that is reviewed and approved by executive leadership and the Board. The platform provides export options in PDF and Word formats. We generate the PDF export, which produces a professionally formatted document with all the governance design information, ready for formal review and approval.

During the review process, the IT Steering Committee suggests some modifications—adjusting meeting frequencies and refining decision authority for the Architecture Review Board. We return to the platform, make these edits, and regenerate the document. This iterative refinement is important; governance design shouldn't be created in isolation and then announced. It benefits from input and buy-in from those who will operate within the governance system. Once all stakeholders provide input and the design is finalized, we mark it as "Approved" in the platform, noting the approval date and the approving body (Board of Directors). This approved governance design becomes the blueprint that guides all subsequent COBIT implementation activities—selecting governance objectives, defining processes, implementing controls, and measuring performance. The design is not static; we'll revisit and refine it as we learn from implementation experience and as business conditions change. However, having this documented, approved governance design provides essential clarity and direction as TechCorp moves from design into implementation in the phases ahead.
