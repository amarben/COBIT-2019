## Key Actions Demonstrated

### EDM01: Governance Framework
- Enable objective
- Set Priority: High
- Set Target: Level 4 (Predictable)
- Implement all 3 practices (Evaluate, Direct, Monitor)
- Rationale: Foundation for all governance activities

### EDM02: Benefits Delivery  
- Enable objective
- Set Priority: High
- Set Target: Level 4
- Implement 2 of 3 practices (building monitoring capability)
- Rationale: Critical gap identified in assessment

### EDM03: Risk Optimization
- Enable objective
- Set Priority: High  
- Set Target: Level 4
- Implement all 3 practices
- Rationale: Critical for financial sector compliance

### EDM04: Resource Optimization
- Enable objective
- Set Priority: Medium
- Set Target: Level 4
- Implement 2 of 3 practices (phased approach)
- Rationale: Important but after foundation/risk/benefits

### EDM05: Stakeholder Engagement
- Enable objective
- Set Priority: High
- Set Target: Level 4
- Implement 1 practice initially (building up)
- Rationale: Foundational communication established

## TechCorp EDM Configuration

| Objective | Status | Priority | Current | Target | Practices | Key Focus |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|-----------|
| EDM01 Governance Framework | Enabled | High | 2 | 4 | 3/3 (100%) | Board oversight, charter, monitoring |
| EDM02 Benefits Delivery | Enabled | High | 1 | 4 | 2/3 (67%) | Portfolio value, benefits tracking (in progress) |
| EDM03 Risk Optimization | Enabled | High | 3 | 4 | 3/3 (100%) | Risk appetite, KRI monitoring, board reporting |
| EDM04 Resource Optimization | Enabled | Medium | 2 | 4 | 2/3 (67%) | Budget approval, resource monitoring (in progress) |
| EDM05 Stakeholder Engagement | Enabled | High | 2 | 4 | 1/3 (33%) | Communication strategy, basic engagement |

## Teaching Points

**Why This Configuration?**
- **EDM01 & EDM03 Full:** Foundational framework and risk management are non-negotiable for financial services
- **EDM02 Partial:** Benefits tracking newly implemented, monitoring capability still building
- **EDM04 Partial:** Resource optimization important but not urgent given TechCorp's financial position
- **EDM05 Minimal:** Basic stakeholder communication established, advanced practices deferred

**73% Implementation Rate:**
- Realistic for initial implementation (not trying to do everything)
- Focused on high-impact practices
- Acknowledges resource constraints and change capacity
- Provides foundation for future maturity

**Board-Level Governance:**
- EDM objectives are ONLY processes performed by Board/Executive
- These provide oversight framework for all management objectives (APO, BAI, DSS, MEA)
- Success here is critical for overall governance effectiveness

**Next Step:** Step 5 - Management Objectives (Select 32 of 35 APO/BAI/DSS/MEA objectives)
