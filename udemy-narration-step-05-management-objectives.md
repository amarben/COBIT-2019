## Video Narration Summary

TechCorp configures 32 of 35 management objectives (91% adoption) with 110 of 160 practices (69% implementation). The demo shows systematic configuration across APO (strategic), BAI (build), DSS (operations), and MEA (monitoring) domains, balancing comprehensive coverage with realistic implementation.

## Key Configuration Results

### APO Domain (Strategic Alignment)
- **Configured:** 12 of 14 objectives (86%)
- **Practices:** 42 of 56 (75%)
- **Excluded:** APO04 Innovation (deferred), APO15 Vendor Management (consolidated)
- **Highlights:** Full implementation of APO01 Strategy, APO05 Portfolio, APO13 Security

### BAI Domain (Build/Acquire/Implement)
- **Configured:** 10 of 11 objectives (91%)
- **Practices:** 35 of 49 (71%)
- **Excluded:** BAI08 Knowledge Management (minimal current need)
- **Highlights:** Strong Agile development (BAI03), Change management (BAI06)

### DSS Domain (Deliver/Service/Support)
- **Configured:** 6 of 6 objectives (100%)
- **Practices:** 21 of 30 (70%)
- **Highlights:** Mature operations (DSS01), Incident management (DSS02), Security services (DSS05)

### MEA Domain (Monitor/Evaluate/Assess)  
- **Configured:** 4 of 4 objectives (100%)
- **Practices:** 12 of 18 (67%)
- **Highlights:** SOX compliance (MEA02), External compliance (MEA03)

---

## Priority Distribution

**High Priority:** 18 objectives
- Security (APO13), Risk (APO12), Portfolio (APO05)
- Change (BAI06), Projects (BAI11)
- Operations (DSS01), Incidents (DSS02), Security Services (DSS05)
- Performance (MEA01), Internal Controls (MEA02), Compliance (MEA03)

**Medium Priority:** 12 objectives

- Requirements, Data, Configuration
- Service requests, Continuity
- Assurance

**Low Priority:** 2 objectives
- APO11 Quality (mature baseline)
- DSS04 Continuity (adequate current state)

## Implementation Patterns

**Full Implementation (100% practices):**
- APO01 Strategy Management
- APO13 Security
- DSS05 Security Services
- MEA03 External Compliance

**High Implementation (75-90%):**
- Portfolio, Risk, Change, Architecture, Projects

**Moderate Implementation (60-75%):**
- Most objectives - balanced, realistic approach

**Minimal Implementation (30-50%):**
- New/emerging capabilities (Innovation, Org Change)

## Platform Features Demonstrated

1. **Domain Navigation:** APO → BAI → DSS → MEA tabs
2. **Bulk Selection:** Enable multiple objectives efficiently
3. **Practice Toggles:** Granular control over implementation
4. **Priority Assignment:** High/Medium/Low per objective
5. **Target Levels:** Individual capability targets per objective
6. **Summary Dashboard:** Real-time statistics (32/35, 110/160)
7. **Progress Tracking:** Percentage complete by domain

## Teaching Points

**Why 32 of 35?**
- Comprehensive but not exhaustive (91% is strong coverage)
- Focuses resources on highest-value objectives
- Acknowledges organizational capacity constraints
- Allows flexibility for future additions

**Why 69% Practice Implementation?**
- Realistic for initial implementation
- Avoids overwhelming the organization
- Focuses on foundational practices
- Provides runway for maturity growth

**Domain Variations:**
- DSS 100% enabled (operations are core strength)
- APO 86% enabled (strategic capabilities still building)
- BAI 91% enabled (delivery capabilities strong with Agile)
- MEA 100% enabled (compliance-driven financial services)
