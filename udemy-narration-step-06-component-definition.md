## Teaching Points

**Why 48 Components?**
- Sufficient to implement 37 objectives effectively
- Not overwhelming (averages 1.3 components per objective)
- Reuses components across objectives (e.g., ServiceNow GRC supports multiple)
- Room to add more as maturity grows

**Component Reuse:**
- ServiceNow GRC supports APO12, MEA02, MEA03, APO08
- IT Steering Committee governs EDM01, APO05, EDM02, EDM04
- Security Policy Framework enables APO13, DSS05, MEA03
- Efficient design avoiding duplication

**Deployment Phasing:**
- Foundational components deployed first (governance structures, core policies)
- Operational components operational (ITSM, security monitoring)
- Advanced capabilities in progress (analytics, AI/ML, optimization)
- Realistic phasing over 12-18 month timeline
