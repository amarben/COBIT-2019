### **Enabler Deployment Summary**

The platform displays our comprehensive deployment dashboard:

**By Category:**
- 🟢 Policies & Procedures: 7 enablers, 85% complete
- 🟡 Tools & Technologies: 7 enablers, 70% complete
- 🟡 Skills Development: 6 enablers, 60% complete
- 🟡 Culture & Behavior: 4 enablers, 50% complete

**Overall Status:**
- **Total Enablers:** 26 across 4 categories
- **Completed:** 16 enablers (66%)
- **In Progress:** 10 enablers (34%)
- **Total Investment:** $5.6M capital + $570K annual operating

**Deployment Health:** GOOD - Majority of enablers deployed, remaining items progressing on schedule. Policies strongest (85%), culture takes longest (50%) which is expected.

### Next Steps

With 66% of enablers deployed and operational, TechCorp has sufficient capability to move into Step 10: Continuous Monitoring. The remaining enablers (IAM, FinOps, EA Tool, Culture Programs) will continue deployment in parallel with monitoring and assessment activities.

The enabler deployment tracking provides visibility into implementation progress and ensures accountability for delivering the components that make governance operational rather than just aspirational. TechCorp's $5.6M investment in governance enablement demonstrates commitment to building sustainable governance capability.

## Platform Features Demonstrated

1. **Category-Based View:** Organized by enabler type
2. **Status Tracking:** Completed/In Progress/Planned
3. **Progress Percentages:** Real-time completion tracking
4. **Investment Tracking:** Financial visibility per enabler
5. **Deployment Metrics:** Quantitative measures (certifications, participants, etc.)
6. **Overall Dashboard:** Summary view across all categories

---

## Note: Simplified for Demonstration

This demo tracks 26 enablers to demonstrate the deployment tracking workflow. A comprehensive enterprise implementation might track 40-50 enablers across additional categories like:
- Services
- Principles
- Applications
- Infrastructure

The key value is the systematic tracking ensuring enablers move from planned → in-progress → completed with clear accountability.
