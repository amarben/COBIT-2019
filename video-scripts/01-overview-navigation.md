## Script

### INTRO (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Application landing on Dashboard]**

"Welcome to the COBIT 2019 Implementation Guide - a comprehensive web application designed to help organizations implement IT governance using the official COBIT 2019 framework.

This tool guides you through a structured 7-phase implementation approach, from identifying your business drivers all the way through to continuous improvement."

### SECTION 1: What is COBIT 2019? (1 minute)

**[Screen: Dashboard visible]**

"COBIT 2019 is ISACA's globally recognized framework for governance and management of enterprise IT. It helps organizations:
- Align IT with business goals
- Manage IT-related risks
- Optimize the value of IT investments
- Ensure compliance with regulations

This application implements the official COBIT 2019 methodology, providing a structured path from assessment to implementation to monitoring."

### SECTION 2: The 7-Phase Approach (2 minutes)

**[Screen: Click sidebar to show all phases]**

"The application is organized around COBIT's 7-phase implementation approach. Let me walk you through each phase:

**[Click to expand Phase 1]**

**Phase 1: What Are the Drivers?**
This is where you start - defining your programme, identifying business drivers, stakeholders, and initial scope.

**[Click to expand Phase 2]**

**Phase 2: Where Are We Now?**
Here you assess your current state - understanding your governance context, evaluating your current capability levels, and identifying issues.

**[Click to expand Phase 3]**

**Phase 3: Where Do We Want to Be?**
This phase helps you define your target state using the Goals Cascade - mapping from Enterprise Goals through Alignment Goals to specific COBIT objectives.

**[Click to expand Phase 4]**

**Phase 4: What Needs to Be Done?**
Build your business case, identify quick wins, and plan your implementation roadmap.

**[Click to expand Phase 5]**

**Phase 5: How Do We Get There?**
The implementation phase - working through governance objectives (EDM), management objectives (APO, BAI, DSS, MEA), defining components, and assigning roles with RACI charts.

**[Click to expand Phase 6]**

**Phase 6: Did We Get There?**
Track benefits realization, measure performance with metrics, and report on value delivered.

**[Click to expand Phase 7]**

**Phase 7: How Do We Keep Momentum?**
Review effectiveness, capture lessons learned, and drive continuous improvement."

### SECTION 3: Navigation Walkthrough (2 minutes)

**[Screen: Demonstrate navigation]**

"Let me show you how to navigate this application:

**[Click Dashboard]**

The Dashboard is your home base - it shows:
- Your overall progress across all 7 phases
- Current phase indicator
- Completion percentages
- Quick links to each phase

**[Click Phase 1 to expand, then click Programme Initiation]**

Notice how phases expand to show individual steps. Each phase has multiple components you can work through.

**[Click back to Dashboard, then click Phase 2 to expand]**

Phase 2 has three main components:
- Governance Context
- Capability Assessment
- Issues Identification

**[Click Capability Assessment]**

When you're in a component, you can see:
- Phase indicator at the top
- Breadcrumb showing where you are
- The component title and description
- Export button to save your work

**[Hover over export button]**

The export functionality lets you generate reports and save your data.

**[Click sidebar toggle button]**

You can also collapse the sidebar for more working space."

### SECTION 4: Data Persistence (1 minute)

**[Screen: Show any form with data entry]**

"One of the key features of this application is automatic data persistence.

**[Type some example data]**

Everything you enter is automatically saved to your browser's local storage. This means:
- You can close the browser and come back later
- Your work is preserved between sessions
- No need to manually save

**[Refresh the page to demonstrate]**

See? When I refresh, all my data is still here.

**Important note:** Your data is stored locally in your browser. If you:
- Clear your browser data
- Switch browsers
- Use a different device

You won't see your data. That's why the export functionality is important - use it to create backups of your work."

---

### SECTION 5: Getting Started (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Click back to Dashboard]**

"Now that you understand the structure, let's talk about how to use this tool:

You'll typically work through the phases sequentially:
1. Start with Phase 1 - Programme Initiation
2. Move through assessment in Phase 2
3. Define your target state in Phase 3
4. And so on...

However, you can also jump to any phase if you need to update something or work non-linearly."

---

### SECTION 6: What's Next (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Dashboard visible]**

"In the next videos, we'll do a deep dive into each phase:
- How to complete each component
- Best practices for data entry
- How to use the Goals Cascade
- Working with RACI charts
- And much more

Let's get started with Phase 1 - Programme Initiation, in the next video."

---

### OUTRO (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Dashboard]**

"This application is designed to be your companion throughout your COBIT 2019 implementation journey. It doesn't replace the official COBIT materials, but it provides structure and organization to help you apply the framework effectively.

In the next video, we'll start with Phase 1 and begin defining your programme. See you there!"

## Key Points to Emphasize

1. **7-Phase Structure** - This is the official COBIT 2019 approach
2. **Data Persistence** - Automatic saving in browser
3. **Sequential but Flexible** - Can work linearly or jump around
4. **Export Important** - For backups and reports
5. **Complementary Tool** - Doesn't replace official COBIT materials
