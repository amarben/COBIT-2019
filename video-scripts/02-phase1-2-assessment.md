### INTRO (30 seconds)

**[Screen: Dashboard]**

"In this video, we're going to work through the first two phases of your COBIT 2019 implementation: Phase 1 - What Are the Drivers?, and Phase 2 - Where Are We Now?

These foundational phases set the stage for your entire implementation, so it's important to complete them thoroughly. Let's get started!"

---

### SECTION 1: Phase 1 - Programme Initiation (4 minutes)

**[Screen: Navigate to Phase 1 > Programme Initiation]**

"Phase 1 is all about understanding WHY you're implementing COBIT 2019. Let's work through the Programme Initiation component.

#### Business Drivers

**[Click 'Add Driver' button]**

First, we identify our business drivers. These are the high-level business reasons for implementing governance. Let me add a few examples:

**[Type first driver]**
- Title: 'Regulatory Compliance'
- Description: 'Need to comply with GDPR and industry regulations'
- Category: 'Compliance'

**[Click Save, then Add Driver again]**

**[Type second driver]**

**[Click Save, then Add Driver again]**

**[Type third driver]**
- Title: 'Risk Management'
- Description: 'Improve cybersecurity posture after recent incidents'
- Category: 'Risk'

**[Click Save]**

Notice how we can categorize drivers. This helps us understand the mix of strategic, operational, compliance, and risk drivers.

#### Stakeholders

**[Scroll to Stakeholders section]**

Next, let's identify our key stakeholders.

**[Click 'Add Stakeholder']**

**[Type first stakeholder]**
- Name: 'Sarah Chen'
- Role: 'Chief Information Officer'
- Interest: 'Sponsor - wants to improve IT governance maturity'
- Influence: 'High'

**[Click Save, Add another]**

**[Scroll down to show completed section]**

Great! Phase 1 is complete. We now have a clear understanding of our drivers, stakeholders, and programme scope."

---

### SECTION 2: Phase 2 - Governance Context (2 minutes)

**[Screen: Navigate to Phase 2 > Governance Context]**

"Now let's move to Phase 2. First, we need to understand our governance context - the environment in which we're implementing COBIT.

#### Organization Details

**[Fill in organization details]**
- Organization Name: 'Acme Financial Services'
- Industry: 'Financial Services'
- Size: 'Medium (500-2000 employees)'
- Number of employees: '850'
- IT Staff: '65'

#### Governance Context

**[Fill in context fields]**

**Regulatory Environment:**
'Highly regulated - subject to financial services regulations, GDPR, PCI-DSS. Annual external audits required.'

**Current Governance Maturity:**
'Limited formal governance. Ad-hoc processes. No enterprise architecture function. IT steering committee meets quarterly.'

**Key Challenges:**
'- Increasing cyber threats
- Regulatory pressure
- Legacy systems
- Shadow IT
- Limited risk management processes'

**Strategic Objectives:**
'- Improve security posture
- Achieve compliance
- Support digital banking initiatives
- Optimize IT costs'

**[Scroll to show completed form]**

This context will inform our design decisions later in Phase 3."

---

### SECTION 3: Focus Areas (2 minutes)

**[Screen: Still in Governance Context, scroll to Focus Areas]**

"One of the powerful features of this tool is Focus Areas. These are predefined scenarios that automatically adjust your capability targets and provide recommendations.

**[Show the 8 Focus Area cards]**

We have 8 focus areas:
- Small/Medium Enterprise (SME)
- Cybersecurity
- Cloud & Infrastructure
- DevOps & Agile
- Digital Transformation
- Privacy & Data Protection
- Financial Services
- Healthcare

Let's select the ones relevant to Acme Financial Services:

**[Click to select 'Financial Services']**
**[Click to select 'Cybersecurity']**
**[Click to select 'Privacy & Data Protection']**

**[Show the selected focus areas highlighted]**

These selections will influence our capability assessment in the next step. The system will automatically recommend higher capability targets for objectives that are critical to these focus areas."

---

### SECTION 4: Capability Assessment (5 minutes)

**[Screen: Navigate to Phase 2 > Capability Assessment]**

"Now comes one of the most important steps - assessing your current capabilities and defining target capabilities for each COBIT objective.

#### Understanding the Assessment Scale

**[Point to the capability level legend]**

COBIT uses a 6-level capability scale:
- **Level 0** - Incomplete: Process not implemented
- **Level 1** - Performed: Process achieves its purpose
- **Level 2** - Managed: Process is planned and managed
- **Level 3** - Established: Process uses a defined standard
- **Level 4** - Predictable: Process operates within limits
- **Level 5** - Optimizing: Process continuously improved

#### Governance Objectives (EDM)

**[Scroll to EDM section]**

Let's start with governance objectives. These are the Board and Executive management responsibilities.

**[Click to expand EDM01]**

**EDM01: Ensured Governance Framework Setting and Maintenance**

**[Show the focus area recommendations]**

Notice the focus area recommendations? Because we selected 'Financial Services' and 'Cybersecurity', the system recommends a minimum capability of Level 3 for EDM01.

**[Set Current: Level 2]**
**[Set Target: Level 4]**
**[Set Priority: High]**

**[Click Save]**

The gap is automatically calculated: we need to improve by 2 levels.

**[Quickly demonstrate EDM02-EDM05]**

Let me quickly set a few more:

- EDM02 (Benefits Delivery): Current 1, Target 3
- EDM03 (Risk Optimization): Current 2, Target 4 (critical for our cybersecurity focus!)
- EDM04 (Resource Optimization): Current 1, Target 3
- EDM05 (Stakeholder Engagement): Current 2, Target 3

#### Management Objectives Overview

**[Scroll down to show APO section]**

Below the governance objectives, we have management objectives grouped into four domains:
- **APO** (Align, Plan, Organize) - 14 objectives
- **BAI** (Build, Acquire, Implement) - 11 objectives
- **DSS** (Deliver, Service, Support) - 6 objectives
- **MEA** (Monitor, Evaluate, Assess) - 4 objectives

That's 35 management objectives total!

**[Expand APO01 as example]**

Let me show you one example:

**APO01: Managed I&T Management Framework**

**[Show focus area recommendation: Level 3 minimum]**

Again, focus areas guide us. For financial services with cybersecurity concerns, a Level 3 framework is essential.

**[Set Current: Level 1]**
**[Set Target: Level 3]**
**[Set Priority: High]**

**[Click to show a few more without filling in detail]**

You would continue this process for all objectives relevant to your organization. You don't have to assess every single objective - focus on those that support your business drivers.

#### Gap Analysis View

**[Scroll to top and click 'Show Gap Analysis' or similar toggle if present]**

The system automatically shows you:
- Objectives with the largest gaps (red)
- Quick wins with small gaps (green)
- Your overall capability maturity"

### SECTION 5: Issues Identification (3 minutes)

**[Screen: Navigate to Phase 2 > Issues Identification]**

"The final component of Phase 2 is identifying current I&T-related issues. This helps you understand the pain points you're trying to solve.

**[Show the four issue categories]**

We track four types of issues:
- Frustration & Pain Points
- Incidents & Problems
- Risks & Vulnerabilities
- Improvement Opportunities

Let's add some examples:

**[Click 'Add Issue']**

#### Issue 1: Cybersecurity Incident
