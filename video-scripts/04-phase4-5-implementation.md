## PART 2: PHASE 5 - IMPLEMENTATION (10 minutes)

### SECTION 4: Governance Objectives - EDM (3 minutes)

**[Screen: Navigate to Phase 5 > Governance Objectives]**

"Phase 5 is where we actually implement the COBIT objectives. Let's start with governance - the EDM objectives.

EDM stands for Evaluate, Direct, and Monitor - the Board and Executive responsibilities.

**[Show the 5 EDM objectives]**

- EDM01: Governance Framework
- EDM02: Benefits Delivery
- EDM03: Risk Optimization
- EDM04: Resource Optimization
- EDM05: Stakeholder Engagement

Let's work through one in detail:

**[Click to expand EDM03: Ensured Risk Optimization]**

#### EDM03: Ensured Risk Optimization

**[Show the objective description]**

'Ensure that enterprise risk appetite and tolerance are understood, articulated and communicated, and that risk to enterprise value related to the use of I&T is identified and managed.'

This is critical for Acme because:
- Financial services = high risk environment
- Recent cybersecurity incidents
- Regulatory requirements

#### Practices (Processes)

**[Show the 3 EDM practices]**

**EDM03.01: Evaluate Risk Management**
- Board evaluates risk management approach
- Reviews risk reports quarterly
- Ensures alignment with enterprise risk

**Status:** [Select 'In Progress']
**Completion:** [Set to 30%]
**Notes:** 'Governance committee established. First risk review scheduled.'

**EDM03.02: Direct Risk Management**
- Board sets risk appetite and tolerance
- Approves risk management framework
- Assigns accountability

**Status:** [Select 'Planned']
**Notes:** 'Risk appetite statement in draft'

**EDM03.03: Monitor Risk Management**
- Board monitors risk KPIs
- Reviews major incidents
- Ensures continuous improvement

**Status:** [Select 'Not Started']

**[Scroll to show Components section if available]**

#### Key Components (Enablers)

For EDM03, key enablers include:
- **Processes:** Risk management process, escalation procedures
- **Organizational Structures:** Risk committee, CISO reporting to board
- **Principles & Policies:** Risk management policy, risk appetite statement
- **Information:** Risk dashboard, incident reports, compliance status
- **Culture & Behavior:** Risk-aware culture, whistleblower protection
- **People & Skills:** Board with risk expertise, trained risk champions
- **Services & Infrastructure:** Risk management tools (GRC platform)

**[Show a few entered or pre-populated]**

The tool helps you think through all seven enablers, not just processes.

**[Click 'Save' or 'Update']**

EDM03 is now being tracked. Let's look at another one quickly.

**[Click EDM01 if not already visible]**

EDM01 is foundational - it sets up the governance framework itself. This is often your starting point because everything else depends on it."

**[Click 'Assign RACI' or similar button]**

Now let's assign roles and responsibilities using RACI."

---

### SECTION 7: RACI Charts (3 minutes)

**[Screen: RACI Chart interface for APO13 or pop-up]**

"RACI charts define who does what. RACI stands for:
- **R**esponsible: Who does the work
- **A**ccountable: Who is answerable (only ONE per activity)
- **C**onsulted: Who provides input
- **I**nformed: Who is kept updated

**[Show the RACI matrix]**

The rows are practices or activities:
- APO13.01: Establish ISMS
- APO13.02: Security Action Plan
- APO13.03: Monitor ISMS

The columns are organizational roles:

**[Point to roles across the top]**

Standard COBIT roles:
- Board
- CEO
- CIO
- CISO
- CFO
- Chief Risk Officer
- Chief Architect
- Head of Development
- Head of IT Operations
- Service Manager
- Business Process Owner
- Project Management Office
- Risk Manager
- Compliance Officer
- Audit
... and more

**[Click to assign RACI values]**

Let's assign APO13.01: Establish ISMS:

**[Click on Board/APO13.01 cell, select 'I' (Informed)]**
Board: Informed - needs to know the ISMS exists

**[Click on CIO/APO13.01 cell, select 'A' (Accountable)]**
CIO: Accountable - ultimately answerable for security

**[Click on CISO/APO13.01 cell, select 'R' (Responsible)]**
CISO: Responsible - does the actual work of establishing ISMS

**[Click on Chief Risk Officer/APO13.01 cell, select 'C' (Consulted)]**
Chief Risk Officer: Consulted - provides risk perspective

**[Click on Compliance Officer/APO13.01 cell, select 'C' (Consulted)]**
Compliance: Consulted - ensures regulatory alignment

**[Click on IT Ops/APO13.01 cell, select 'C' (Consulted)]**
IT Operations: Consulted - operational input needed

**[Show the completed row]**

Notice:
- Only ONE 'A' (CIO)
- One primary 'R' (CISO) but could have multiple
- Several 'C' (consulted) - cross-functional effort
- Board is 'I' (informed) - governance oversight

**[Quickly show a second row]**

APO13.03: Monitor ISMS:

- Board: C (Consulted - reviews metrics)
- CIO: A (Accountable)
- CISO: R (Responsible - produces metrics)
- Audit: C (Consulted - independent view)
- Risk Manager: I (Informed)

**[Show the matrix view]**

**[Click 'Save RACI' or 'Export RACI']**

You can export this RACI chart for your governance documentation.

#### Why RACI Matters:
- Eliminates confusion about roles
- Ensures accountability
- Prevents duplication of effort
- Identifies gaps (no one assigned)
- Standard COBIT 2019 templates provided
- Customize for your organization structure"
