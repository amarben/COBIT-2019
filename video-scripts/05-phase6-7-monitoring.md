## PART 1: PHASE 6 - MONITORING & MEASUREMENT (7 minutes)

### SECTION 1: Benefits Realization (3 minutes)

**[Screen: Navigate to Phase 6 > Benefits Tracking or Benefits Realization]**

"Remember the business case we built in Phase 4? Now we need to track whether we're actually realizing those benefits.

### SECTION 2: Performance Measurement - KPIs (4 minutes)

**[Screen: Navigate to Phase 6 > Metrics or Performance Measurement]**

"Benefits tracking is great, but we need more granular measurement. That's where KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) come in.

COBIT 2019 distinguishes between two types of metrics:

**[Show legend or explanation]**

- **Lag Indicators:** Measure outcomes (what happened) - backward looking
- **Lead Indicators:** Measure drivers (what's happening) - forward looking

Let's define KPIs for some of our key objectives:

#### EDM03: Risk Optimization KPIs

**[Click to add metrics for EDM03]**

**Lag Indicator 1: Risk Incidents**

**[Fill in metric]**
- Name: 'Number of significant I&T risk incidents'
- Type: 'Lag - Outcome'
- Formula: 'Count of severity 3+ incidents per quarter'
- Target: '<3 per quarter'
- Current: '2 (Q2 2024)'
- Trend: '↓ Improving (was 5 in Q1)'
- Owner: 'Chief Risk Officer'
- Frequency: 'Quarterly'

**Lead Indicator 1: Risk Assessment Coverage**

**[Fill in metric]**
- Name: 'Percentage of critical assets with current risk assessment'
- Type: 'Lead - Driver'
- Formula: '(Assets assessed in last 12 months / Total critical assets) × 100'
- Target: '>95%'
- Current: '87%'
- Trend: '↑ Improving (was 60%)'
- Owner: 'CISO'
- Frequency: 'Monthly'

**[Point out the relationship]**

See the relationship? If we keep risk assessments current (lead), we should reduce risk incidents (lag).

**Lead Indicator 2: Risk Reporting Timeliness**

**[Fill in metric]**
- Name: 'Average days to report significant risks to Board'
- Type: 'Lead - Driver'
- Formula: 'Average time from risk identification to Board notification'
- Target: '<7 days'
- Current: '5 days'
- Trend: '→ Stable (was 12 days)'

**[Show the metric set]**

For EDM03, we're tracking:
- 1 lag indicator (incidents)
- 2 lead indicators (assessment coverage, reporting speed)

This gives us both outcome measurement and early warning.

#### APO13: Managed Security KPIs

**[Show or add metrics for APO13]**

**Lag Indicator: Security Incidents**

**[Fill in]**
- Name: 'Number of security breaches/incidents'
- Type: 'Lag'
- Target: '<5 per month'
- Current: '3 per month'
- Trend: '↓ Down from 8/month'

**Lead Indicator 1: Security Awareness**

**[Fill in]**
- Name: 'Percentage of staff completing security training'
- Type: 'Lead'
- Target: '>95%'
- Current: '92%'
- Trend: '↑ Up from 45%'

**Lead Indicator 2: Vulnerability Remediation**

**[Fill in]**
- Name: 'Percentage of critical vulnerabilities remediated within SLA'
- Type: 'Lead'
- Target: '>95% within 7 days'
- Current: '89%'
- Trend: '↑ Up from 60%'

**Lead Indicator 3: Security Policy Compliance**

**[Fill in]**
- Name: 'Policy compliance rate (audit findings)'
- Type: 'Lead'
- Target: '>90% compliance'
- Current: '85%'
- Trend: '↑ Up from 60%'

#### DSS02: Service Requests & Incidents KPIs

**[Show metrics for DSS02]**

**Lag Indicator: MTTR**

**[Fill in]**
- Name: 'Mean Time to Resolve (MTTR) incidents'
- Type: 'Lag'
- Target: '<4 hours for P2, <24h for P3'
- Current: '3.5h (P2), 20h (P3)'
- Trend: '↓ Improved (was 6h/36h)'

**Lead Indicator: First Contact Resolution**

**[Fill in]**
- Name: 'Percentage resolved at first contact'
- Type: 'Lead'
- Target: '>70%'
- Current: '68%'
- Trend: '↑ Up from 45%'
